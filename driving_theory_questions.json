    "comment": "Defensive driving means that, on the one hand, you do not insist on your right of way in road traffic and, on the other hand, you also take into account potential mistakes made by other road users. Therefore, you do not have to drive over-cautiously - this could in turn pose a danger of its own and impede the flow of traffic. Driving defensively means preparing yourself as well as possible for dangers emanating from yourself or from outside and thus averting them in good time. You can achieve this, for example, by braking early enough to avoid a rear-end collision in front of traffic lights. Generally driving slower protects you against drivers who misjudge a traffic light phase in the heat of the moment or confuse left and right.",

Worn tires have a much longer braking distance on wet roads. The legally prescribed tread depth of 1.6 millimeters is not sufficient in terms of safety. At this tread depth, the risk of aquaplaning is already very high. With aquaplaning, the vehicle slips uncontrollably.",

Other road users are often not prepared for an unexpectedly high speed. But driving too slowly can also be a hazard, as risky overtaking manoeuvres and rear-end collisions become more frequent in this case. In addition, stationary vehicles can become a dangerous obstacle. To be seen better by other drivers, it helps to switch on your vehicle's lights even during the day.",

    "comment": "Children often behave unpredictably, which is why other road users always have to count on the unexpected. Due to external stimuli in the environment, small children are constantly distracted from the road and traffic. They continuously let their eyes hike in the area and get stuck with interesting events or objects. The noise perception also only develops in the course of life and is only available to a limited extent in children. That is why children can usually not assign the many noises in road traffic to a certain direction and it is more difficult for them to assess them purely acoustically from which direction a vehicle approaches.\nIn addition to the perception of the direction, the perception of distances, speeds and braking distance in childhood is not yet fully pronounced. Therefore, children can often only overlook the traffic situation incompletely.",

These include, above all, forest locations and bridges. In forests, the cold lasts longer than in open fields. Because of the shade, moisture takes longer to evaporate here. On bridges, roadways store less heat than on the ground. Bridge roadways are therefore colder and ice up faster. The moisture of the surrounding water and the increased wind due to the unprotected location also promote icing.",

Certain driving styles consume extra fuel: Short-distance driving, especially when the engine is still cold, stop-and-go traffic, for example in crowded inner cities and searching for a parking space. On top of that, in areas with heavy traffic, the risk of smog from the exhaust emissions of vehicles increases. Driving at full throttle will not only cause noise, but your fuel consumption will increase disproportionately. However, once you are only 20% below the maximum speed, you reduce your fuel consumption by about 40%. Carpooling is also good for the environment.",

All important information about this topic can be found in the operating instructions of your vehicle. If the tire internal pressure is too high or too low, there will be an increase in pollutant emissions. Even unbalanced driving can lead to high fuel consumption. Therefore, instead of accelerating to the upper rotational speed limit and only change gears then, you should shift up in the lower or middle rotational speed limit range. This means you consume less fuel and at the same time reduce the exhaust emissions of your car.",

Driving smoothly means avoiding unnecessary acceleration and deceleration. For example, by slowly rolling toward a red light, you can use the rest of the momentum to drive on if it is already green when you reach the traffic light. Only having to give gas, saves fuel compared to starting from standing completely still.",

Heat can be generated that irreparably damages the tire.",

The correct tire pressure specified by the manufacturer is important for a stable vehicle position in curves. It is tailored to the overall design of the vehicle. Too low or too different tire pressure reduces driving stability and increases the risk of skidding on turns. Too high a load has an influence on the driving stability. There is not too little loading.",

In turns, much of the stiction forces are needed for the cornering forces that hold the vehicle in the lane. If you brake too much, the stiction is instead used largely for the transmission of the braking force. As a result, the cornering forces are too low to counteract the centrifugal force, the same applies to excessive speed. On wet roads, a film of water between the road surface and the tire reduces grip and promotes skidding.",

This hazard arises from the fact that strong cross winds from the right push your vehicle to the left, whereupon you automatically countersteer. As you overtake a truck, you slipstream into it; the crosswind is gone instantly and you have to adjust the steering. As soon as you pull out of the slipstream, the pressure starts up again with the crosswind; You have to countersteer again.",

This reduces the traction and thereby extends the braking distance. This lubricating film also forms on the windscreen and on the brake drums. If you use the windscreen wipers, they will first worsen your view and smudge the window. On the brake drums, this lubricating film leads to a slower response of the brakes in wet conditions.",

Due to the additional loading of the roof, the side wind attacks an even larger area. This increases the side wind sensitivity. In addition, the focus of the vehicle shifts upwards. As a result, the vehicle tends to be aside in curves.",

This type of lashing is also known as tie-down lashing.\nThe load usually stands freely on the loading surface and is only secured by the increased force applied. In most cases, the frictional force between the loading surface and the load is increased.\nThe load is secured with the aid of load securing equipment such as lashing straps, lashing chains, anti-slip mats or cover nets and with the aid of attachment points on the loading surface.\nThis prevents the load from slipping.",

It is important to check the tension of the lashing devices, as the necessary contact force and thus the required friction can only be achieved with sufficient tension. In addition, this method is only suitable for dimensionally stable loads; flexible goods can deform under the tension, which means that the pre-tensioning force is lost and load securing is no longer guaranteed.",

Removing stones trapped between the twin tires prevents them from being thrown out while driving, causing damage to other vehicles or causing accidents. In addition, loaded bulk material must be adequately covered to prevent material from falling onto the road while driving and thus posing a danger to following traffic. These measures serve to protect all road users and help prevent pollution and hazards in road traffic.",

This ensures optimal driving stability and controllability of the trailer.\nA load center of gravity that is far back can have a serious impact on the driving stability of your trailer. This can cause the trailer to sway more easily during sudden steering movements or at higher speeds, increasing the risk of an accident.\nIf the tire pressure on your trailer is too low, it can affect the driving stability of your trailer. On the one hand, low tire pressure leads to poorer road grip, which makes your trailer more uncontrollable when cornering. On the other hand, low tire pressure leads to increased tire wear, which increases the risk of tire damage while driving.\nA shock absorber that is already leaking can also have a negative impact on the driving stability of your trailer. The leaking shock absorber on your trailer loses its damping properties, which can lead to unstable driving behavior and dangerous situations that are difficult to control.",

To determine it, the car driver can place a piece of wood or a pipe underneath the coupling point of the trailer and place a bathroom scale underneath. The bearing load is displayed. The minimum load to be carried by the towing vehicle shall not be less than 4% of the trailer's total weight for trailers with a gross vehicle weight of not more than 3.5 tons. However, a minimum load of 25 kg is sufficient. In this example, the minimum support load is 24 kg. When loading the trailer, you, as a car driver, must be careful not to undercut or exceed the minimum and maximum permitted load. By shifting the load, you can influence the bearing load.",

If this is not the case, it can increase the risk of skidding in poor road conditions.\nThe suspension, for example, has the task of keeping all tyres on the road with the same force. If the suspension is damaged, it can no longer do this. The risk of skidding also increases if the tyre pressure is incorrect or if the vehicle is incorrectly or unevenly loaded.\nThis is because the tyres cannot apply the same force to the road and you lose grip more quickly.",

So if the battery of the electric vehicle is already fully charged, the vehicle cannot regain the energy and the braking effect through recuperation may not be available. Instead, the vehicle has to fall back on conventional brakes. The recuperation can also be reduced or deactivated if the battery is too cold. This can reduce the braking effect through recuperation.",

These forces can destabilize the vehicle and cause it to tip over, especially if the center of gravity is high. Inadequately secured loads can slip due to these forces, further affecting the vehicle's balance and increasing the risk of accidents. Correct load securing is therefore essential to ensure the stability of the vehicle and increase road safety.",

    "comment": "If the internal tire pressure is too high or too low, the driving behavior will deteriorate. In addition, the tire wear increases. If the tire pressure is too low, the tire heats up by flexing, while the \"soft\" tire is excessively compressed and relieved at the footprint. The consequences are an increased fuel consumption and a high rolling resistance, in addition, the driving stability decreases. If the tire pressure is too high, the tire may burst. It is important to check the tire pressure regularly and to take the information recommended by the manufacturer into account. The tire pressure has no influence on the thinking distance.",

Check the radiator fan for blockages and have it replaced by a specialist if necessary.",

The tire pressure should be checked, as a spare wheel with insufficient air pressure is not ready for use in the event of a breakdown and therefore cannot fulfill its function as a reserve. Because the spare tire often remains unused, it can lose air pressure over time; Regular checks ensure that it can be used immediately if necessary.",
