Theme 1.1.,Danger Teaching,1.1.01 Chapter,Basic Forms Of Traffic Behavior,1.1.01-001,1.1.01-001,4 Points,What should you understand by defensive driving?,A. Not insisting on your rights; B. Allowing for other people's mistakes; C. Stopping as a precaution at every crossroads,A. Not insisting on your rights; B. Allowing for other people's mistakes,"Defensive driving means that, on the one hand, you do not insist on your right of way in road traffic and, on the other hand, you also take into account potential mistakes made by other road users. Therefore, you do not have to drive over-cautiously - this could in turn pose a danger of its own and impede the flow of traffic. Driving defensively means preparing yourself as well as possible for dangers emanating from yourself or from outside and thus averting them in good time. You can achieve this, for example, by braking early enough to avoid a rear-end collision in front of traffic lights. Generally driving slower protects you against drivers who misjudge a traffic light phase in the heat of the moment or confuse left and right.",,https://www.clickclickdrive.de/fragenkatalog/en/1.1.-danger-teaching/1.1.01-basic-forms-of-traffic-behavior/1.1.01-001

Inattentiveness; C. Driving too close behind the vehicle in front,A. Unexpectedly heavy braking; B. Inattentiveness; C. Driving too close behind the vehicle in front,"There are several possible scenarios that lead to rear-end collisions. If someone brakes too suddenly and unexpectedly, a collision can occur. Tailgating is also a common cause of rear-end collisions, especially if the driver behind is distracted and unfocused. A sufficiently large safety distance can help to avoid such risks.",,https://www.clickclickdrive.de/fragenkatalog/en/1.1.-danger-teaching/1.1.01-basic-forms-of-traffic-behavior/1.1.01-002

For example, the driver in question could stop in an open lane to ask a passer-by for directions. It is also possible that the non-local driver may be late in recognising the correct route and therefore brake or signal late before bends, junctions and exits.",,https://www.clickclickdrive.de/fragenkatalog/en/1.1.-danger-teaching/1.1.01-basic-forms-of-traffic-behavior/1.1.01-101

Vehicles proceeding too slowly for no good reason; C. Motor vehicles breaking down because they have run out of fuel,A. Stalling the engine in dense traffic; B. Vehicles proceeding too slowly for no good reason; C. Motor vehicles breaking down because they have run out of fuel,"One avoidable obstruction to road traffic is stalling the engine. This is especially a beginner's mistake, which in the worst case can result in a rear-end collision. However, this can be easily remedied by appropriate practice on secluded roads. In addition, according to road traffic regulations, every vehicle must be refuelled in good time to prevent stalling. Finally, it is also part of your duty as a motorist to drive at an appropriate speed, i.e. never drive so slowly for no reason that you could obstruct traffic and provoke an accident.",,https://www.clickclickdrive.de/fragenkatalog/en/1.1.-danger-teaching/1.1.01-basic-forms-of-traffic-behavior/1.1.01-102

Because it obstructs the flow of traffic; B. Because it increases the danger of rear-end collisions; C. Because it encourages vehicle drivers behind to overtake dangerously,"Road traffic regulations prohibit unnecessary slow driving, as it impedes the flow of traffic and greatly increases the risk of accidents: it tempts following road users to make risky overtaking manoeuvres at blind spots.

Vehicle in a spectacular colour,A. Worn tyres; B. Headlights set too high,"Safety risks include incorrectly adjusted headlamps. If they are set too low, they create poor visibility for the driver. Lights that are set too high can lead to extreme glare from oncoming traffic and cause serious accidents. The tread depth of the tires is an important safety factor. Worn tires have a much longer braking distance on wet roads. The legally prescribed tread depth of 1.6 millimeters is not sufficient in terms of safety. At this tread depth, the risk of aquaplaning is already very high. With aquaplaning, the vehicle slips uncontrollably.",,https://www.clickclickdrive.de/fragenkatalog/en/1.1.-danger-teaching/1.1.01-basic-forms-of-traffic-behavior/1.1.01-104

Driving mistakes,A. Microsleep; B. Lack of concentration; C.

Through failure to maintain suitable speed; C. By having lights turned on during day,A. Through vehicles at a standstill; B. Through failure to maintain suitable speed,"A major cause of danger in road traffic is driving too fast. This is especially true for beginners, who then easily lose control of their vehicle. Other road users are often not prepared for an unexpectedly high speed. But driving too slowly can also be a hazard, as risky overtaking manoeuvres and rear-end collisions become more frequent in this case. In addition, stationary vehicles can become a dangerous obstacle. To be seen better by other drivers, it helps to switch on your vehicle's lights even during the day.",,https://www.clickclickdrive.de/fragenkatalog/en/1.1.-danger-teaching/1.1.01-basic-forms-of-traffic-behavior/1.1.01-111

Due to external stimuli in the environment, small children are constantly distracted from the road and traffic. They continuously let their eyes hike in the area and get stuck with interesting events or objects. The noise perception also only develops in the course of life and is only available to a limited extent in children. That is why children can usually not assign the many noises in road traffic to a certain direction and it is more difficult for them to assess them purely acoustically from which direction a vehicle approaches.
In addition to the perception of the direction, the perception of distances, speeds and braking distance in childhood is not yet fully pronounced.

Insufficient or uneven tyre pressure; C. Load is too small,A. Faulty shock-absorbers; B. Insufficient or uneven tyre pressure,Defective shock absorbers can be the cause of a vehicle skidding or swinging off the curve when turning. The correct tire pressure specified by the manufacturer is important for a stable vehicle position in curves. It is tailored to the overall design of the vehicle. Too low or too different tire pressure reduces driving stability and increases the risk of skidding on turns. Too high a load has an influence on the driving stability.

Slight acceleration when leaving the bend,A. Heavy braking; B. Driving fast on a wet roadway,"In curves, the following factors can lead to skidding: 1. excessive speed; 2. wet or icy roads; 3. strong braking. In turns, much of the stiction forces are needed for the cornering forces that hold the vehicle in the lane. If you brake too much, the stiction is instead used largely for the transmission of the braking force. As a result, the cornering forces are too low to counteract the centrifugal force, the same applies to excessive speed. On wet roads, a film of water between the road surface and the tire reduces grip and promotes skidding.",,https://www.clickclickdrive.de/fragenkatalog/en/2.1.-danger-teaching/2.1.01-basic-forms-of-traffic-behaviour/2.1.01-003

Insufficient tyre pressure in the trailer tyres; C. A leaking shock absorber,"The load of a trailer should be distributed so that the center of gravity is as close as possible to the axle of the trailer. This ensures optimal driving stability and controllability of the trailer.
A load center of gravity that is far back can have a serious impact on the driving stability of your trailer. This can cause the trailer to sway more easily during sudden steering movements or at higher speeds, increasing the risk of an accident.
If the tire pressure on your trailer is too low, it can affect the driving stability of your trailer. On the one hand, low tire pressure leads to poorer road grip, which makes your trailer more uncontrollable when cornering. On the other hand, low tire pressure leads to increased tire wear, which increases the risk of tire damage while driving.
A shock absorber that is already leaking can also have a negative impact on the driving stability of your trailer. The leaking shock absorber on your trailer loses its damping properties, which can lead to unstable driving behavior and dangerous situations that are difficult to control.",,https://www.clickclickdrive.de/fragenkatalog/en/2.6.-rules-on-the-operation-of-the-vehicles/2.6.03-trailer-operation/2.6.03-121
