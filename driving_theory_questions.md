## Theme 1.1. Danger Teaching


### 1.1.01 Chapter Basic Forms Of Traffic Behavior


#### Question 1.1.01-001

**Points:** 4 Points

**What should you understand by defensive driving?**

**Options:**
- A. Not insisting on your rights
- B. Allowing for other people's mistakes
- C. Stopping as a precaution at every crossroads

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Not insisting on your rights
- B. Allowing for other people's mistakes

**Explanation:**
Defensive driving means that, on the one hand, you do not insist on your right of way in road traffic and, on the other hand, you also take into account potential mistakes made by other road users. Therefore, you do not have to drive over-cautiously - this could in turn pose a danger of its own and impede the flow of traffic. Driving defensively means preparing yourself as well as possible for dangers emanating from yourself or from outside and thus averting them in good time. You can achieve this, for example, by braking early enough to avoid a rear-end collision in front of traffic lights. Generally driving slower protects you against drivers who misjudge a traffic light phase in the heat of the moment or confuse left and right.

#### Question 1.1.01-002

**Points:** 4 Points

**What can be the causes of rear-end collisions?**

**Options:**
- A. Unexpectedly heavy braking
- B. Inattentiveness
- C. Driving too close behind the vehicle in front

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Unexpectedly heavy braking
- B. Inattentiveness
- C. Driving too close behind the vehicle in front

**Explanation:**
There are several possible scenarios that lead to rear-end collisions. If someone brakes too suddenly and unexpectedly, a collision can occur. Tailgating is also a common cause of rear-end collisions, especially if the driver behind is distracted and unfocused. A sufficiently large safety distance can help to avoid such risks.

#### Question 1.1.01-003

**Points:** 2 Points

**Which of these is a good example of "anticipatory driving"?**

**Options:**
- A. I respond as soon as possible to probable changes in the road traffic situation
- B. I attempt to identify the intentions of other road users, as soon as possible
- C. I limit my observation of road traffic as much as possible on the vehicle travelling directly in front of me

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I respond as soon as possible to probable changes in the road traffic situation
- B. I attempt to identify the intentions of other road users, as soon as possible

**Explanation:**
Driving with foresight is essential when it comes to road safety. You should always keep an eye on cars directly in front of you so that you can react immediately if necessary. The same applies to all road users in your vicinity.

#### Question 1.1.01-004

**Points:** 3 Points

**You are to drive a motor vehicle with which you are unfamiliar. Why do you have to be particularly careful to begin with?**

**Options:**
- A. - of the arrangement and the function of the controls
- B. - of its braking characteristics
- C. - of its manoeuvrability

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - of the arrangement and the function of the controls
- B. - of its braking characteristics
- C. - of its manoeuvrability

**Explanation:**
Every driver is accustomed to the driving behaviour and characteristics of his or her motor vehicle. Every vehicle has different handling characteristics due to its particular centre of gravity, dimensions and weight. Even the clutch, cornering behaviour and braking distance of the same models can differ. The driver must familiarise himself carefully with these characteristics, as well as with the controls of the instruments.

#### Question 1.1.01-101

**Points:** 3 Points

**You are driving in a built-up area behind a vehicle with number plates that are not local. What could happen?**

**Options:**
- A. - could brake unexpectedly
- B. - may switch on the direction indicators too late before turning
- C. - could stop unexpectedly to ask the way

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - could brake unexpectedly
- B. - may switch on the direction indicators too late before turning
- C. - could stop unexpectedly to ask the way

**Explanation:**
If you identify a non-local road user from the number plate, you must expect unexpected manoeuvres due to their lack of knowledge of the area. For example, the driver in question could stop in an open lane to ask a passer-by for directions. It is also possible that the non-local driver may be late in recognising the correct route and therefore brake or signal late before bends, junctions and exits.

---

#### Question 1.1.01-102

**Points:** 3 Points

**What can cause unnecessary obstructions?**

**Options:**
- A. Stalling the engine in dense traffic
- B. Vehicles proceeding too slowly for no good reason
- C. Motor vehicles breaking down because they have run out of fuel

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Stalling the engine in dense traffic
- B. Vehicles proceeding too slowly for no good reason
- C. Motor vehicles breaking down because they have run out of fuel

**Explanation:**
One avoidable obstruction to road traffic is stalling the engine. This is especially a beginner's mistake, which in the worst case can result in a rear-end collision. However, this can be easily remedied by appropriate practice on secluded roads. In addition, according to road traffic regulations, every vehicle must be refuelled in good time to prevent stalling. Finally, it is also part of your duty as a motorist to drive at an appropriate speed, i.e. never drive so slowly for no reason that you could obstruct traffic and provoke an accident.

---

#### Question 1.1.01-103

**Points:** 3 Points

**Why must you not drive extra slowly for no good reason?**

**Options:**
- A. Because it obstructs the flow of traffic
- B. Because it increases the danger of rear-end collisions
- C. Because it encourages vehicle drivers behind to overtake dangerously

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because it obstructs the flow of traffic
- B. Because it increases the danger of rear-end collisions
- C. Because it encourages vehicle drivers behind to overtake dangerously

**Explanation:**
Road traffic regulations prohibit unnecessary slow driving, as it impedes the flow of traffic and greatly increases the risk of accidents: it tempts following road users to make risky overtaking manoeuvres at blind spots. In addition, the risk of rear-end collisions increases drastically due to the resulting speed differences.

---

#### Question 1.1.01-104

**Points:** 4 Points

**What can present a danger?**

**Options:**
- A. Worn tyres
- B. Headlights set too high
- C. Vehicle in a spectacular colour

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Worn tyres
- B. Headlights set too high

**Explanation:**
Safety risks include incorrectly adjusted headlamps. If they are set too low, they create poor visibility for the driver. Lights that are set too high can lead to extreme glare from oncoming traffic and cause serious accidents. The tread depth of the tires is an important safety factor. Worn tires have a much longer braking distance on wet roads. The legally prescribed tread depth of 1.6 millimeters is not sufficient in terms of safety. At this tread depth, the risk of aquaplaning is already very high. With aquaplaning, the vehicle slips uncontrollably.

---

#### Question 1.1.01-107

**Points:** 4 Points

**How can you tell that you are getting tired while you are driving?**

**Options:**
- A. Heavy eyelids
- B. Frequent yawning
- C. Quicker reaction time

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Heavy eyelids
- B. Frequent yawning

**Explanation:**
Fatigue leads to prolonged reaction times as well as reduced attention while driving. Its signs include excessive yawning. You can also recognise sleep deprivation by the fact that you find it increasingly difficult to keep your eyes open.

---

#### Question 1.1.01-108

**Points:** 4 Points

**What can happen if you ignore signs of tiredness?**

**Options:**
- A. Microsleep
- B. Lack of concentration
- C. Driving mistakes

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Microsleep
- B. Lack of concentration
- C. Driving mistakes

**Explanation:**
You should never ignore the first signs of tiredness, such as dwindling concentration, because you may be overcome by microsleep as a result. This in turn often leads to serious, sometimes even life-threatening driving errors.

---

#### Question 1.1.01-109

**Points:** 4 Points

**What should you do if you start feeling tired while driving?**

**Options:**
- A. Take a break straightaway
- B. Get out of the car and move around in the fresh air
- C. Listen to stimulating music

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Take a break straightaway
- B. Get out of the car and move around in the fresh air

**Explanation:**
Since tiredness can lead to dangerous situations during car journeys, you should plan sufficient breaks for longer journeys. During this recovery phase, a walk in the fresh air is recommended to get your circulation going again.

---

#### Question 1.1.01-110

**Points:** 4 Points

**How does tiredness affect your driving?**

**Options:**
- A. Decreases alertness
- B. Limits awareness
- C. Delays reactions

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Decreases alertness
- B. Limits awareness
- C. Delays reactions

**Explanation:**
Fatigue at the wheel increases the risk of accidents for the following reasons: concentration and attention noticeably decreases; perception is limited, reaction is significantly delayed.

---

#### Question 1.1.01-111

**Points:** 4 Points

**How could a dangerous situation arise?**

**Options:**
- A. Through vehicles at a standstill
- B. Through failure to maintain suitable speed
- C. By having lights turned on during day

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Through vehicles at a standstill
- B. Through failure to maintain suitable speed

**Explanation:**
A major cause of danger in road traffic is driving too fast. This is especially true for beginners, who then easily lose control of their vehicle. Other road users are often not prepared for an unexpectedly high speed. But driving too slowly can also be a hazard, as risky overtaking manoeuvres and rear-end collisions become more frequent in this case. In addition, stationary vehicles can become a dangerous obstacle. To be seen better by other drivers, it helps to switch on your vehicle's lights even during the day.

---

#### Question 1.1.01-112

**Points:** 4 Points

**What could cause the vehicle to leave the road?**

**Options:**
- A. Distraction
- B. Inattention
- C. Tiredness

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Distraction
- B. Inattention
- C. Tiredness

**Explanation:**
Drivers often drift off the road due to inattention or lack of concentration. Distractions, such as talking on a mobile phone, can also lead to such driving errors. A third cause of leaving the road is fatigue combined with microsleep.

---

#### Question 1.1.01-113

**Points:** 4 Points

**What is a frequent cause of serious accidents?**

**Options:**
- A. Failure to pay attention to other road traffic
- B. Driving too close to the vehicle in front
- C. Failure to adjust speed accordingly

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Failure to pay attention to other road traffic
- B. Driving too close to the vehicle in front
- C. Failure to adjust speed accordingly

**Explanation:**
Serious accidents often result: from risky overtaking manoeuvres and rear-end collisions due to unnecessary slow driving, from fatigue and delayed reactions, and from children acting unpredictably and rashly.

### 1.1.02 Chapter Behavior Towards Pedestrians


#### Question 1.1.02-004

**Points:** 4 Points

**What should you reckon with when approaching children?**

**Options:**
- A. Rash behaviour on the part of the children
- B. Fast and correct reactions of the children
- C. Proper road conduct of the children

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Rash behaviour on the part of the children

**Explanation:**
Children can always behave ill-considered and are therefore exempt from the principle of trust towards other road users. Thus, when children approach you, you must reduce your speed to be ready to brake.

---

#### Question 1.1.02-005

**Points:** 5 Points

**What conduct must you expect of children at zebra crossings?**

**Options:**
- A. They will run onto the zebra crossing without paying attention to traffic
- B. They will turn around on the zebra crossing for no apparent reason and run back
- C. They will wait at the curb because they always correctly judge the speed and distance of approaching vehicles

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. They will run onto the zebra crossing without paying attention to traffic
- B. They will turn around on the zebra crossing for no apparent reason and run back

**Explanation:**
Children generally do not have the necessary training to always behave according to the rules in road traffic. Therefore, it is quite conceivable that they do not know the meaning of a zebra crossing and enter the road despite approaching vehicles or suddenly run back after crossing.

---

#### Question 1.1.02-009-B

**Points:** 5 Points

**What must you do?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-009-B.png)

**Options:**
- A. Brake heavily immediately and remain ready to brake
- B. Continue at the same speed because the children will certainly stop
- C. Proceed at the same speed so as not to obstruct the traffic following behind

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Brake heavily immediately and remain ready to brake

**Explanation:**
If a child suddenly runs across the road without paying attention to the traffic, you should immediately slow down and continue driving ready to brake. Also, make sure that other children follow. It is essential to stay at walking pace to be able to stop completely if necessary.

---

#### Question 1.1.02-022

**Points:** 4 Points

**What do you have to reckon with when children are waiting at traffic lights?**

**Options:**
- A. - will already start running when the traffic lights in my driving direction change from green to amber
- B. - will also start running when the light is red because they cannot wait since it's taking them too long
- C. - will push each other onto the roadway

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - will already start running when the traffic lights in my driving direction change from green to amber
- B. - will also start running when the light is red because they cannot wait since it's taking them too long
- C. - will push each other onto the roadway

**Explanation:**
Due to a lack of life experience as well as insufficient education, children do not always behave according to the rules in road traffic and, for example, get into the lane during a scuffle. Furthermore, you must expect children to suddenly run across the road, even if the traffic lights are still red or the lights of the cross-traffic are just changing.

---

#### Question 1.1.02-023

**Points:** 4 Points

**A group of children are cycling on a cycle path that ends. What do you have to reckon with?**

**Options:**
- A. - will move onto the roadway without paying attention
- B. - will move too far onto the roadway
- C. - will get off their bicycles and wait until the roadway is clear

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - will move onto the roadway without paying attention
- B. - will move too far onto the roadway

**Explanation:**
Children in particular, who are generally not overly familiar with traffic rules, tend to make unpredictable manoeuvres. Therefore, especially at the end of a cycle path, you should be aware that the young road users could drive onto the road without warning. Furthermore, it often happens that children ride in groups next to each other and thus partially swerve into your lane.

#### Question 1.1.02-024-B

**Points:** 4 Points

**Which statements are correct?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-024-B.png)

**Options:**
- A. You may pass on the right-hand side at walking speed provided that passengers are not obstructed and you are sure no-one is endangered
- B. If no-one is obstructed or endangered, you may pass on the right-hand side at a speed faster than walking speed
- C. Passengers must allow moving traffic to pass before boarding

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. You may pass on the right-hand side at walking speed provided that passengers are not obstructed and you are sure no-one is endangered

**Explanation:**
If you do not obstruct or endanger the passengers getting on or off the tram, you may pass the stopping tram slowly at walking speed. It is important to note that passengers have absolute priority in this situation and do not have to let moving traffic pass. If necessary, you as the vehicle driver must stop and wait.

---

#### Question 1.1.02-026-B

**Points:** 4 Points

**What must you heed in this situation?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-026-B.png)

**Options:**
- A. - not overtake the bus while it is still moving
- B. - pass the stationary bus at walking speed provided you are sure that passengers are not endangered
- C. - overtake the bus while it is still moving

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - not overtake the bus while it is still moving
- B. - pass the stationary bus at walking speed provided you are sure that passengers are not endangered

**Explanation:**
If a public bus or school bus has its hazard lights on and is still moving, you must not overtake it. If the bus has come to a halt at the stop, you may pass at walking pace and at an appropriate distance. This is necessary in order not to endanger the passengers getting on and off the bus. If you are travelling in the opposite lane, you must also slow down or stop to ensure the safety of the passengers.

---

#### Question 1.1.02-027

**Points:** 4 Points

**What do you have to reckon with when elderly persons using walking frames cross the road?**

**Options:**
- A. They may stop on the road
- B. They may turn round and go back
- C. They will cross the road slowly

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. They may stop on the road
- B. They may turn round and go back
- C. They will cross the road slowly

**Explanation:**
When elderly people with walking aids cross the road, you have a higher duty of care. The principle of trust is suspended. You must expect these people to stop suddenly or turn around unexpectedly. Older people also take a comparatively long time to cross the road.

---

#### Question 1.1.02-028

**Points:** 4 Points

**A person in a wheelchair is travelling along the road although there is a pavement on the right. What do you do?**

**Options:**
- A. I follow behind the wheelchair until I can overtake it
- B. I overtake it, leaving plenty of room on the side because the wheelchair may swing out
- C. I honk the horn to indicate that the person is not behaving correctly

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I follow behind the wheelchair until I can overtake it
- B. I overtake it, leaving plenty of room on the side because the wheelchair may swing out

**Explanation:**
Disabled and elderly people sometimes do not behave in a roadworthy manner due to physical limitations. Therefore, please be especially careful and be sure to show consideration. Expect the wheelchair user to suddenly and unexpectedly swerve and drive even further into the lane. In such situations, it is not permitted to use the horn or drive around the person at high speed.

---

#### Question 1.1.02-029

**Points:** 4 Points

**Having crossed the road, a person in a wheelchair cannot get up the curb and onto the pavement. What do you do?**

**Options:**
- A. I stop and switch on the hazard warning lights
- B. I get out of the car and help the person in the wheelchair
- C. I honk the horn and drive around the person

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I stop and switch on the hazard warning lights
- B. I get out of the car and help the person in the wheelchair

**Explanation:**
You should help the person. To do this, you may stop and switch on the hazard warning lights to warn other road users of possible dangers. It is not permitted to honk your horn and drive around the person in this situation. This would frighten and unsettle the wheelchair user.

---

#### Question 1.1.02-032

**Points:** 4 Points

**Who has a severe visual handicap?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-032.png)

**Options:**
- A. The man
- B. The child
- C. The woman

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. The man

**Explanation:**
You must expect a severe visual impairment in the case of persons with the following markings: If a person is wearing a yellow armband with three black dots and/or a white blind person's cane extended diagonally.

---

#### Question 1.1.02-036

**Points:** 4 Points

**What do you do?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-036.png)

**Options:**
- A. Stop
- B. Let the man cross the road
- C. Make eye contact with the man

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Stop
- B. Let the man cross the road

**Explanation:**
Visually impaired pedestrians often wear an armband and have a guide dog with a white driving harness with them. It is not possible to make eye contact with a visually impaired road user. Therefore, you are obliged to show special consideration here. You must stop to allow the pedestrian to cross the road safely.

---

#### Question 1.1.02-037

**Points:** 3 Points

**What must you be aware of?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-037.png)

**Options:**
- A. Pedestrians crossing the road in front of the bus
- B. People crossing the road from left to right to get to the bus
- C. The bus will reverse suddenly

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Pedestrians crossing the road in front of the bus
- B. People crossing the road from left to right to get to the bus

**Explanation:**
Where buses or trams wait at stops, you must always assume that people will suddenly step onto the road. Some passengers run quickly across the street to reach the bus. When passengers get off the bus, they often enter the lane surprisingly without paying attention to the traffic. Because the reversing light is not lit, you as the driver behind you can be sure that the bus will leave the bus stop driving forwards.

---

#### Question 1.1.02-038-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**What risks must you be aware of?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-038-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. - proceed onto the road
- B. - continue on the cycle path
- C. - stop moving

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - proceed onto the road

**Explanation:**
Cyclists do not always behave in a way that is appropriate for traffic. Here, even if the child has previously looked to your left, he or she could ride onto the roadway. To avoid a dangerous situation, you should therefore reduce your speed and be ready to brake.

---

#### Question 1.1.02-039-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**How do you behave?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-039-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. watch out for children
- B. be ready to brake
- C. continue driving at the same speed

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. watch out for children
- B. be ready to brake

**Explanation:**
Reduce speed and watch the two children very closely. Be careful and ready to brake. Stop if the children's behaviour makes this necessary.

---

#### Question 1.1.02-040-M

**Points:** 5 Points

**What must you be aware of?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-040-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. - turn to the left
- B. - go to the other side of the road
- C. - not impede me as I proceed

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - turn to the left
- B. - go to the other side of the road

**Explanation:**
It is always possible that cyclists do not behave in a way that is appropriate for the traffic. A cyclist could turn left or change sides of the road without indicating this with a hand signal. If there are two cyclists, it is possible that the second will also follow the first without hand signals. Therefore, you should be ready to brake even if the cyclists continue straight ahead.

---

#### Question 1.1.02-041-M

**Points:** 5 Points

**What risks must you be aware of?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-041-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. the children will not get off the road in time
- B. some children will turn around again
- C. all children will wait on the pavement

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. the children will not get off the road in time
- B. some children will turn around again

**Explanation:**
If a ball is lying on the road, it can be assumed that a child will come and fetch it. For you as a driver, this means: stop immediately so that the child can fetch the ball safely. With children, you have to expect that they will behave in a way that is contrary to traffic regulations and that they will not be able to assess dangers correctly.

---

#### Question 1.1.02-042-M

**Points:** 5 Points

**How should you behave?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-042-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. slow to walking pace
- B. remain ready to brake
- C. continue driving at same speed

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. slow to walking pace
- B. remain ready to brake

**Explanation:**
The rule here is: reduce speed immediately, be ready to brake and drive slowly past the situation. It can be assumed that children who are playing are not paying attention to the traffic and are not behaving in a way that is appropriate for the traffic.

#### Question 1.1.02-046-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**In this situation, which vehicles may drive past, at walking speed only, while ensuring there is no danger to any passengers?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-046-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. - are travelling in the same direction
- B. - are oncoming

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - are travelling in the same direction
- B. - are oncoming

**Explanation:**
When the hazard warning lights of a bus are switched on at a bus stop, all vehicles in both directions must pass the bus at walking speed. There shall be no danger to or obstruction of passengers boarding or alighting the bus.

#### Question 1.1.02-050-M

**Points:** 5 Points

**Why must you drive slowly here and be ready to brake?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-050-M.png)

[Video: videos/1_1_02-050-M.mp4](videos/1_1_02-050-M.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. Because the traffic situation is confusing
- B. Because there is a child on the carriageway
- C. Because [the white van] is moving off

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because the traffic situation is confusing
- B. Because there is a child on the carriageway

**Explanation:**
The child behind the van on the left runs towards the roadway. You cannot see whether it will stop. Therefore, be especially attentive and careful in this unclear traffic situation. Drive slowly and be ready to brake.

#### Question 1.1.02-051-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**What is the correct course of action in this situation?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-051-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. I stop and allow the person to cross the road
- B. I drive to the left past the person, leaving sufficient clearance space
- C. I flash my headlights to signal to the person that I am giving way

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I stop and allow the person to cross the road

**Explanation:**
The man is wearing a yellow armband and has a guide dog with him. He is blind or visually impaired and cannot see the traffic situation. Special care must be taken for blind people. Therefore, you must let him cross the road in front of you.

---

#### Question 1.1.02-052

**Points:** 4 Points

**Why must you anticipate that children might behave unpredictably in road traffic situations?**

**Options:**
- A. - are easily distracted
- B. - are frequently unable to fully grasp the road traffic situation
- C. - are frequently unable to correctly detect the direction from which a sound is coming

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - are easily distracted
- B. - are frequently unable to fully grasp the road traffic situation
- C. - are frequently unable to correctly detect the direction from which a sound is coming

**Explanation:**
Children often behave unpredictably, which is why other road users always have to count on the unexpected. Due to external stimuli in the environment, small children are constantly distracted from the road and traffic. They continuously let their eyes hike in the area and get stuck with interesting events or objects. The noise perception also only develops in the course of life and is only available to a limited extent in children. That is why children can usually not assign the many noises in road traffic to a certain direction and it is more difficult for them to assess them purely acoustically from which direction a vehicle approaches.
In addition to the perception of the direction, the perception of distances, speeds and braking distance in childhood is not yet fully pronounced. Therefore, children can often only overlook the traffic situation incompletely.

#### Question 1.1.02-107

**Points:** 4 Points

**A child is walking on the pavement with a dog on a lead. Can this cause a dangerous situation?**

**Options:**
- A. Yes, if the dog suddenly runs onto the roadway and pulls the child along behind
- B. Yes, if the dog tears away and the child runs after the dog
- C. No, because dogs are afraid of traffic

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Yes, if the dog suddenly runs onto the roadway and pulls the child along behind
- B. Yes, if the dog tears away and the child runs after the dog

**Explanation:**
Dangerous situations can arise here. The dog could break loose, and the child could run after him. It would also be conceivable that the dog would run onto the road, and the child would pull along. They should, therefore, drive slowly and be ready to brake.

#### Question 1.1.02-108-B

**Points:** 4 Points

**What must you heed in this situation?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-108-B.png)

**Options:**
- A. - pass at walking speed only
- B. - pass only if you are sure that passengers are not endangered
- C. - not pass under any circumstances

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - pass at walking speed only
- B. - pass only if you are sure that passengers are not endangered

**Explanation:**
When public transport and school buses are at a stop and their hazard warning lights are switched on, the following applies: Vehicles may only pass them at walking speed and at a sufficient distance. This applies to oncoming traffic as well as to vehicles travelling in the same direction as the bus. Any danger to passengers must be ruled out by you as the driver of the vehicle.

#### Question 1.1.02-109-B

**Points:** 4 Points

**Which statements are correct in this situation?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-109-B.png)

**Options:**
- A. Cars coming from the opposite direction may pass the bus provided that they do so with care
- B. You may pass the bus provided that you do so with care
- C. As you are coming from the opposite direction, you do not need to worry about the bus

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Cars coming from the opposite direction may pass the bus provided that they do so with care
- B. You may pass the bus provided that you do so with care

**Explanation:**
Vehicles coming from both directions may only pass public buses, school buses and trams stopped at bus stops with caution. As the bus has not switched on its hazard warning lights, you do not have to slow your vehicle down to walking speed. Be especially attentive in the situation!

#### Question 1.1.02-110-B

**Points:** 4 Points

**Which statements are correct in this situation?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-110-B.png)

**Options:**
- A. The bus may be passed in either lane but no faster than at walking speed
- B. Vehicles in both lanes must stop if passengers would otherwise be endangered
- C. The vehicles in the left lane may pass the bus without paying any special attention

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. The bus may be passed in either lane but no faster than at walking speed
- B. Vehicles in both lanes must stop if passengers would otherwise be endangered

**Explanation:**
If a bus is at a stop and its hazard warning lights are switched on, you as the driver may only pass the bus at walking speed on the same carriageway. Keep a sufficient distance. If necessary, you must stop and wait. The reason for this is the safety of bus passengers, which must always be ensured. This also applies to road users travelling in oncoming traffic on the same carriageway.

#### Question 1.1.02-112

**Points:** 5 Points

**In a residential area a ball rolls out in front of your vehicle. How must you react?**

**Options:**
- A. Brake
- B. Continue driving
- C. Avoid hitting it

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Brake

**Explanation:**
If a ball rolls in front of your vehicle in a residential area, you must expect a child to suddenly run into the road. You must therefore brake and be ready to stop, as the principle of trust does not apply in this case.

---

#### Question 1.1.02-113

**Points:** 5 Points

**You are approaching children playing on the pavement. How must you behave?**

**Options:**
- A. Slow down and be ready to brake
- B. Continue driving as before so as not to impede the traffic behind you
- C. Sound your horn and continue driving

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Slow down and be ready to brake

**Explanation:**
Children playing on the pavement could unexpectedly run onto the roadway. The principle of trust is therefore suspended. You must reduce speed and be ready to brake.

#### Question 1.1.02-114

**Points:** 4 Points

**What should you anticipate in this situation?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-114.png)

**Options:**
- A. - will run onto the carriageway, pulling the child behind it
- B. - will break free and the child will run after it
- C. - will be kept securely under control by the child

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - will run onto the carriageway, pulling the child behind it
- B. - will break free and the child will run after it

**Explanation:**
In this situation, you should be prepared for the danger of the dog running into the lane and dragging the child behind it, and of the dog breaking loose and the child running after it.

#### Question 1.1.02-115

**Points:** 5 Points

**In this situation, do you have to proceed slowly and be ready to brake?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-115.png)

[Video: videos/1_1_02-115.mp4](videos/1_1_02-115.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. Yes, because passengers could cross the road from in front of the bus
- B. Yes, because pedestrians not alighting from the bus could cross the road
- C. Yes, because the bus will begin moving immediately

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Yes, because passengers could cross the road from in front of the bus
- B. Yes, because pedestrians not alighting from the bus could cross the road

**Explanation:**
As the bus is at the stop and flashing on the right, you should only drive past it very carefully. In addition, there is a person standing directly in front of the bus and thus in your immediate vicinity. You must also expect passengers to get off the bus. Other people may approach the bus from the other side of the road and want to get on. You should therefore slow down in any case so that you can brake immediately if necessary.

#### Question 1.1.02-116

**Points:** 4 Points

**The tram has just become stationary at the stop. What is the right course of action?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-116.png)

**Options:**
- A. - may not be endangered
- B. - may not be impeded
- C. - may be warned using the horn

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - may not be endangered
- B. - may not be impeded

**Explanation:**
You may carefully pass a stopping tram at walking speed - but only if this does not endanger or obstruct any passengers.

#### Question 1.1.02-117

**Points:** 5 Points

**Why must you pause here?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-117.png)

[Video: videos/1_1_02-117.mp4](videos/1_1_02-117.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. - the child
- B. - the motorbike
- C. - the off-road vehicle

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - the child

**Explanation:**
It's not clear what the child will do. It would be possible for the child to run onto the road without paying attention to the traffic. Therefore, you must carefully pass through: You should drive very slowly and be ready to brake.

---

#### Question 1.1.02-119

**Points:** 5 Points

**What should you do?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-119.png)

**Options:**
- A. Slow to walking pace
- B. Remain ready to brake
- C. Continue driving as before

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Slow to walking pace
- B. Remain ready to brake

**Explanation:**
Special caution is always required towards children in road traffic. In this situation, you must expect that the small child will continue to drive onto the road behind the van. Slow down to walking speed and remain alert and ready to brake at all times. Stop if necessary if you are not sure how the child will behave. It would be grossly negligent to just honk your horn and drive on.

#### Question 1.1.02-120-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**What should you do?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-120-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. Brake early, to clearly indicate to the pedestrians that I am allowing them to cross
- B. Continue driving, even if the pedestrians stop briefly
- C. Arc around the pedestrians, to avoid impeding the following traffic

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Brake early, to clearly indicate to the pedestrians that I am allowing them to cross

**Explanation:**
Pedestrians always have absolute priority at pedestrian crossings. Therefore, brake your vehicle in good time and in a clearly visible manner. This way, pedestrians can easily see that you are fulfilling your obligation to wait and that they can enter the roadway. Even if the pedestrians are still standing at the roadside, it would be absolutely forbidden to simply drive on.

---

#### Question 1.1.02-121-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**What should you do?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-121-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. Wait to allow pedestrians to cross the road
- B. Continue driving, because there is sufficient time before the pedestrians have reached my side of the road
- C. Continue driving, because there are pedestrians on the left side of the road only

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Wait to allow pedestrians to cross the road

**Explanation:**
When pedestrians wait at a zebra crossing to cross the road, they have priority. This also applies if they are on the left-hand side of the road. You should therefore brake in good time. Pedestrians must be able to see that you are complying with your obligation to stop. Even if the pedestrians stop first and wait, you must give them the right of way in a clearly visible manner.

---

#### Question 1.1.02-122

**Points:** 4 Points

**What actions should you anticipate at such stops?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-122.png)

**Options:**
- A. Pedestrians will step off the tram-stop island unheedingly
- B. Pedestrians will run across the road to the tram-stop island
- C. Pedestrians will wait until the road is clear

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Pedestrians will step off the tram-stop island unheedingly
- B. Pedestrians will run across the road to the tram-stop island

**Explanation:**
Pedestrians are required to wait at such traffic islands. You are therefore allowed to pass the tram even if the tram doors are still open. But because people often behave carelessly when getting on and off the tram, dangerous situations arise time and again. For example, without paying attention to the traffic, passengers simply run across the carriageway to reach the tram.

#### Question 1.1.02-123-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**You want to turn right. What must you be prepared for?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-123-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. The truck will stop
- B. [The pedestrian] could let the truck pass by and then cross the road in front of me
- C. After the truck has taken the turn, pedestrians could approach from the opposite side of the road

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. The truck will stop
- B. [The pedestrian] could let the truck pass by and then cross the road in front of me
- C. After the truck has taken the turn, pedestrians could approach from the opposite side of the road

**Explanation:**
If you want to turn right, road users travelling in a straight line here have priority. These may be pedestrians or cyclists who want to cross the road. If a truck turns right in front of you, it is also possible that a pedestrian will let it pass. In that case, the lorry would block your view of the other side of the road and thus of the road users travelling from there.

#### Question 1.1.02-124-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**What must you be prepared for?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-124-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. For persons crossing
- B. For visual obstructions
- C. For vehicle doors opening

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. For persons crossing
- B. For visual obstructions
- C. For vehicle doors opening

**Explanation:**
Where there are many parked cars, you should always drive carefully and considerately. On the one hand, your view is obstructed by the parked vehicles. Secondly, you must always be aware that car doors may be carelessly opened. Other road users may also want to cross the lane between the parked cars.

#### Question 1.1.02-125-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**What should you anticipate?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-125-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. That adults could walk onto the road
- B. That children could appear between the vehicles
- C. That it could be necessary to brake heavily

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. That adults could walk onto the road
- B. That children could appear between the vehicles
- C. That it could be necessary to brake heavily

**Explanation:**
The "Children" danger sign on the right makes it clear that increased attention and a special degree of caution are necessary at this point. In addition to children, adults can of course also suddenly step onto the roadway between parked vehicles here, requiring heavy braking.

---

#### Question 1.1.02-126

**Points:** 4 Points

**Why are older pedestrians at more risk than younger ones from road traffic?**

**Options:**
- A. They frequently have poorer sight and hearing
- B. They frequently react more slowly and are less mobile
- C. They frequently misjudge the speed of vehicles

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. They frequently have poorer sight and hearing
- B. They frequently react more slowly and are less mobile
- C. They frequently misjudge the speed of vehicles

**Explanation:**
Older road users see less well, hear less well, react more slowly and misjudge the speed of vehicles. Be prepared for these people to recognise dangers too late and react too late or not at all.

---

#### Question 1.1.02-127

**Points:** 4 Points

**What must you be aware of in residential areas with low traffic volumes?**

**Options:**
- A. That children playing run onto the road
- B. That cyclists are inattentive
- C. That all adults obey the road traffic regulations

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. That children playing run onto the road
- B. That cyclists are inattentive

**Explanation:**
In residential areas, low traffic levels often give children and adults a feeling of high safety. Some road users are thoughtless here, which often leads to inappropriate traffic behaviour. In such areas, always expect children playing, inattentive cyclists and pedestrians suddenly entering the road. Drive particularly carefully and attentively, as children in particular are unable to properly assess the dangers of road traffic.

---

#### Question 1.1.02-128

**Points:** 4 Points

**What actions should you anticipate from persons at the pedestrian crossing?**

**Options:**
- A. They will look neither left nor right
- B. They will unexpectedly walk onto the road
- C. Sometimes they turn back half-way across

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. They will look neither left nor right
- B. They will unexpectedly walk onto the road
- C. Sometimes they turn back half-way across

**Explanation:**
Zebra crossings have a protective function for pedestrians. They give them priority over other road users. Some pedestrians thoughtlessly trust this protection and cross the roadway without paying attention to the traffic. At zebra crossings, be aware that pedestrians and especially elderly or vulnerable people may enter the roadway without looking left and right. It is also possible that pedestrians will turn halfway around when the traffic lights turn red.

---

#### Question 1.1.02-129

**Points:** 4 Points

**A pedestrian with a white stick wants to cross the road in front of you. What should you do?**

**Options:**
- A. - reduce speed and stop if necessary
- B. - give a warning signal
- C. - continue driving at the same speed

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - reduce speed and stop if necessary

**Explanation:**
The white cane shows you that this road user is blind or at least severely visually impaired. The stick is also the sign that the person is allowed to participate in road traffic without an escort. You must always treat blind and visually impaired people with increased consideration. Reduce your speed and stop if necessary. Do not honk: you would frighten and unsettle the person.

#### Question 1.1.02-130-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**What should you anticipate?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-130-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. That pedestrians will walk onto the road in front of me
- B. That children will suddenly appear between the vehicles
- C. That pedestrians will wait until I have driven past

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. That pedestrians will walk onto the road in front of me
- B. That children will suddenly appear between the vehicles

**Explanation:**
The "Children" danger sign on the right warns you to take extra care. With many parked vehicles, however, you must always assume that people will step onto the carriageway unexpectedly. Of course, in addition to children, adults can also fail to behave in a roadworthy manner and suddenly appear between the vehicles.

#### Question 1.1.02-131

**Points:** 3 Points

**What should you anticipate?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-131.png)

**Options:**
- A. That pedestrians will suddenly walk onto the road
- B. That doors of vehicles will be opened
- C. That vehicles will begin moving

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. That pedestrians will suddenly walk onto the road
- B. That doors of vehicles will be opened
- C. That vehicles will begin moving

**Explanation:**
In a traffic situation with several parked vehicles and different road users, the parked vehicles impair your visibility. Pedestrians can be expected to emerge between cars to cross the road. It is also possible for people to get out of vehicles or for vehicles to drive off without paying attention to the current traffic situation.

#### Question 1.1.02-132

**Points:** 4 Points

**What is your assessment of this situation?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-132.png)

**Options:**
- A. The female pedestrian may walk unheedingly onto the road
- B. The pedestrian with the moped may change direction suddenly
- C. I can continue driving at the same speed

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. The female pedestrian may walk unheedingly onto the road
- B. The pedestrian with the moped may change direction suddenly

**Explanation:**
You should only pass the waiting pedestrian at the side of the road with an appropriate safe distance and very carefully. The same applies to a moped rider who is properly pushing his moped on the right-hand side of the road. If necessary, you can also change to the left lane.

---

#### Question 1.1.02-133

**Points:** 4 Points

**A person at the side of the road is wearing a yellow armband with three black spots. What does this armband indicate?**

**Options:**
- A. The wearer is disabled
- B. I am obliged to behave in a particular way towards this person
- C. This person belongs to a particular profession

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. The wearer is disabled
- B. I am obliged to behave in a particular way towards this person

**Explanation:**
If you see a person at the side of the road wearing a yellow armband with three black dots, this means for you: the principle of trust has been suspended. You now have an increased duty of care. This is because the armband indicates a physical limitation in the form of a severe visual impairment. If visually impaired persons wear this armband and/or a white stick, they are allowed to move in traffic without an escort.

#### Question 1.1.02-134-M

**Points:** 5 Points

**Why do you have to reduce your speed here?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_02-134-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. - child
- B. - motorbike
- C. - [SUV]

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - child

**Explanation:**
If a van is parked in front of a house and a child runs out of the house, the child may run into the road directly in front of the van. Children rarely pay attention to traffic. Therefore, you should be able to brake immediately in an emergency. To do this, you should reduce your driving speed.

#### Question 1.1.02-135

**Points:** 4 Points

**What should you anticipate when pedestrians are crossing the road?**

**Options:**
- A. - be inattentive
- B. - come to a sudden stop
- C. - turn back, after half-way

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - be inattentive
- B. - come to a sudden stop
- C. - turn back, after half-way

**Explanation:**
When a pedestrian crosses the roadway, it is not certain that he will continue this action to the opposite side of the road. It is also quite possible that he will stop, turn around or continue with a delay.

### 1.1.03 Chapter Road And Weather Conditions


#### Question 1.1.03-001

**Points:** 3 Points

**Where must you particularly reckon with dirt on the roadway and therefore danger of skidding?**

**Options:**
- A. Near construction sites
- B. At junctions with farm tracks
- C. At innercity crossroads

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Near construction sites
- B. At junctions with farm tracks

**Explanation:**
At junctions of dirt roads and at construction sites, the roadway is likely to be heavily soiled with soil, clay and dirt. Vehicles coming from there bring the dirt onto the road with the tread grooves of their tyres. In wet conditions, this means an increased risk of slipping.

---

#### Question 1.1.03-002

**Points:** 4 Points

**Why must the safe distance maintained be much greater on a wet roadway than on a dry roadway?**

**Options:**
- A. The contact between the tyres and the roadway deteriorates
- B. Wheel-spray can impair visibility
- C. Braking distances are greater

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. The contact between the tyres and the roadway deteriorates
- B. Wheel-spray can impair visibility
- C. Braking distances are greater

**Explanation:**
On wet roads, the adhesion between the tyre and the road is poorer due to the water film. As a result, the braking distance is considerably longer. In addition, the spray from the car in front worsens visibility. The same applies to rainy weather.

#### Question 1.1.03-003

**Points:** 4 Points

**Where must you especially reckon with ice on the roadway?**

**Options:**
- A. On bridges
- B. On stretches of road running through forest
- C. On frequently used stretches of road

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. On bridges
- B. On stretches of road running through forest

**Explanation:**
You must expect increased icing on the road in the following areas: in damp, shady and windy locations that favour the formation of ice on the road. These include, above all, forest locations and bridges. In forests, the cold lasts longer than in open fields. Because of the shade, moisture takes longer to evaporate here. On bridges, roadways store less heat than on the ground. Bridge roadways are therefore colder and ice up faster. The moisture of the surrounding water and the increased wind due to the unprotected location also promote icing.

#### Question 1.1.03-004

**Points:** 4 Points

**What are the special conditions when driving along tree-lined avenues in the cold season?**

**Options:**
- A. Wet leaves as well as white frost, black ice and snowy surfaces are particularly dangerous above all on cambered roadways
- B. White frost and black ice occur more frequently and more unexpectedly on cobbled roadways than on other roadways
- C. Tree-lined avenues are particularly safe in winter because the treetops protect the road from snow

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Wet leaves as well as white frost, black ice and snowy surfaces are particularly dangerous above all on cambered roadways
- B. White frost and black ice occur more frequently and more unexpectedly on cobbled roadways than on other roadways

**Explanation:**
The particularities of driving along avenues in the cold season result from the basic characteristics of an avenue: it is characterised by uniform rows of trees running parallel to the roadway on the right and left. The foliage of the trees creates shade on the roadway. This keeps moisture longer, which favours icing in cold weather. If the leaves fall on the roadway, it also significantly increases the risk of the vehicle slipping.

#### Question 1.1.03-005

**Points:** 4 Points

**There is oil on the road. What should you do now?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_03-005.png)

**Options:**
- A. I notify the fire brigade
- B. I avoid heavy braking and abrupt steering movements
- C. I swerve onto the left-hand side of the road

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I notify the fire brigade
- B. I avoid heavy braking and abrupt steering movements

**Explanation:**
If there is oil on the road, avoid jerky steering and heavy braking; there is a risk of slipping. Provided other road users are not endangered, you can move to the left lane. Notify the fire brigade so that the oil can be bound.

- B. An extended braking distance
- C. A narrowed carriageway

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. A vehicle coming from the right
- B. An extended braking distance
- C. A narrowed carriageway

**Explanation:**
Due to the weather and the corresponding conditions on the road, you have to be prepared for an extended braking distance, for a vehicle coming from the right (right before left) and for a narrowed lane.

#### Question 1.1.03-007-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**You are driving following a heavy rain shower. What should you be aware of in this situation?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_03-007-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. I should maintain a large safety distance between me and the vehicle ahead
- B. It is difficult for me to detect uneven areas on the road surface
- C. Splash water might impair my vision

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I should maintain a large safety distance between me and the vehicle ahead
- B. It is difficult for me to detect uneven areas on the road surface
- C. Splash water might impair my vision

**Explanation:**
When it rains, your view worsens. Therefore, you should enlarge your safety distance to the vehicle in front, as your braking distance is extended. Spray water can be whirled up from the vehicle in front by a wet road. This means that bumps are difficult to recognize.

#### Question 1.1.03-102-B

**Points:** 4 Points

**Why does driving on this stretch of road require greater alertness on the part of the motorist?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_03-102-B.png)

**Options:**
- A. The road surface is uneven and road grip varies
- B. A tram might come from the opposite direction
- C. Driving on the tracks is dangerous

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. The road surface is uneven and road grip varies
- B. A tram might come from the opposite direction
- C. Driving on the tracks is dangerous

**Explanation:**
A tram may come towards you on the tracks, in which case the lane becomes much narrower for you. Tram tracks are also dangerous, especially when wet, because they become slippery. In addition, as there are also cobblestones, the road surface is uneven and has varying degrees of grip. This can increase the braking distance.

#### Question 1.1.03-104

**Points:** 4 Points

**The road is icy for a short distance. What should you avoid here, if possible?**

**Options:**
- A. Accelerating
- B. Braking
- C. Steering wheel movements

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Accelerating
- B. Braking
- C. Steering wheel movements

**Explanation:**
On icy roads, your tyres do not grip as well as usual. Therefore, you should avoid dangerous situations, i.e. neither brake nor accelerate abruptly. You should also refrain from sudden steering movements. This could cause your vehicle to skid. Only brake and steer away from the icy surface.

---

#### Question 1.1.03-105

**Points:** 4 Points

**While driving, how can you safely check whether the road is icy?**

**Options:**
- A. By carefully applying the brakes at very low speed
- B. By jerking the steering wheel to the left and right
- C. By rapid acceleration

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. By carefully applying the brakes at very low speed

**Explanation:**
Test the condition of the road by braking carefully at low speed. Be sure to pay attention to the traffic behind you. Avoid jerking the steering or accelerating sharply. This could cause your vehicle to swerve and become uncontrollable.

#### Question 1.1.03-108-B

**Points:** 3 Points

**Why must you drive with particular caution here?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_03-108-B.png)

**Options:**
- A. Because the roadway is slippery
- B. Because the view is obscured by the bend
- C. Because the roadway is made narrower by the wrongly parked car

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because the roadway is slippery
- B. Because the view is obscured by the bend
- C. Because the roadway is made narrower by the wrongly parked car

**Explanation:**
Snow makes the road slippery. There is a curve in front of you that is difficult to see and a car is parked there. You will have to pull out into the oncoming lane to drive around it. Therefore, drive extra carefully to be able to react at any time. In addition, your vehicle needs suitable tyres for good grip.

---

#### Question 1.1.03-109

**Points:** 3 Points

**Where must you be prepared to encounter sudden fog?**

**Options:**
- A. Near rivers
- B. In marshy areas
- C. Near lakes

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Near rivers
- B. In marshy areas
- C. Near lakes

**Explanation:**
Humidity at low temperatures favours the formation of fog. Therefore, fog is more likely to occur around lakes, watercourses and rivers as well as moorland areas.

---

#### Question 1.1.03-110

**Points:** 4 Points

**What do you do if visibility is drastically reduced by fog?**

**Options:**
- A. Adapt your speed in time to visibility conditions
- B. Increase the distance from the vehicle in front
- C. Drive up close to the vehicle in front so you can use its rear lights as an orientation point

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Adapt your speed in time to visibility conditions
- B. Increase the distance from the vehicle in front

**Explanation:**
Adjust your speed and driving style to the visibility conditions. Make sure that you can stop within sight. If necessary, increase the safety distance to the vehicle in front. Fog with a visibility of 50 metres, for example, means that you may drive at a maximum of 50 km/h.

#### Question 1.1.03-112-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**What is the right course of action here?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_03-112-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. I brake carefully
- B. I allow [the pedestrian] on the right to cross the road
- C. I carefully continue driving, because there are no markings visible on the road

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I brake carefully
- B. I allow [the pedestrian] on the right to cross the road

**Explanation:**
Even if the lane marking is not visible, the traffic signs show the presence of the pedestrian crossing. Brake carefully to prevent your vehicle from skidding.

---

#### Question 1.1.03-114-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**Why do you have to pay particular attention here?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_03-114-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. Because it is not clear which direction the road will take
- B. Because the road surface is uneven
- C. Because oncoming traffic could cut the corner

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because it is not clear which direction the road will take
- B. Because the road surface is uneven
- C. Because oncoming traffic could cut the corner

**Explanation:**
There is a long curve in front of you, the end of which you cannot see. A fast-moving vehicle could come towards you from there and cut your lane. The road surface is also uneven and does not have an even surface. So anticipate insufficient grip and drive at an adapted speed.

#### Question 1.1.03-115

**Points:** 4 Points

**You want to exit the motorway; to which must you pay particularly close attention?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_03-115.png)

[Video: videos/1_1_03-115.mp4](videos/1_1_03-115.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. The red motorbike
- B. The yellow truck
- C. The white van

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. The red motorbike

**Explanation:**
In the video you see a red motorcycle on the deceleration lane. Later it is no longer visible, because it is located in the blind spot on the right side of you. Now if you also swing out on the deceleration lane, you'll cut the motorcyclist - a dangerous situation for him. Make sure that the rider passes right by you before changing lanes.

---

#### Question 1.1.03-116

**Points:** 4 Points

**Why might taking the right turn be dangerous here?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_03-116.png)

**Options:**
- A. Because I might possibly not be able to stop in time, if pedestrians are crossing the side street
- B. Because vehicles emerging from the side street could start to skid
- C. Because my vehicle might start to skid if I take the turn too fast

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because I might possibly not be able to stop in time, if pedestrians are crossing the side street
- B. Because vehicles emerging from the side street could start to skid
- C. Because my vehicle might start to skid if I take the turn too fast

**Explanation:**
The winter weather makes the road slippery and increases the braking distance at the intersection. Your car or oncoming vehicles could skid or slide away uncontrollably. Therefore, reduce your speed in good time and do not brake abruptly. The road on the right is still full of snow and therefore even slicker. Watch out for pedestrians when turning. They always have priority when you turn.

---

#### Question 1.1.03-117

**Points:** 4 Points

**You are driving on this road which is not inside a built-up area. What should you prepare yourself for?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_03-117.png)

**Options:**
- A. Pedestrians using the road
- B. The road is narrow
- C. Pedestrians walking only off the road

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Pedestrians using the road
- B. The road is narrow

**Explanation:**
On the right you will see the sign for a car park. Expect pedestrians walking away from or towards their parked cars. As the pavements are impassable due to the masses of snow, evasive pedestrians could use the roadway. The weather causes slippery conditions and increases your braking distance. Drive slowly.

---

#### Question 1.1.03-118

**Points:** 5 Points

**What must you be aware of?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_03-118.png)

[Video: videos/1_1_03-118.mp4](videos/1_1_03-118.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. - turn on the rear fog lights
- B. - drive at 50 km/h maximum
- C. - drive at 80 km/h maximum

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - turn on the rear fog lights
- B. - drive at 50 km/h maximum

**Explanation:**
The fog is so dense here that you cannot see farther than 50 meters. With such a limited view, obstacles and dangerous situations cannot be detected in time when you're driving at high speed. Therefore, you must reduce your speed to a maximum of 50 km/h and drive very carefully. Turn on the rear fog-lamp of your vehicle.

---

#### Question 1.1.03-119-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**Why is it necessary to maintain a larger safety distance to the vehicle ahead?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_03-119-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. Because spray water could otherwise impede visibility
- B. Because the braking distance is longer than on a dry road
- C. Because uneven areas of the road will otherwise be detected later

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because spray water could otherwise impede visibility
- B. Because the braking distance is longer than on a dry road
- C. Because uneven areas of the road will otherwise be detected later

**Explanation:**
There is a risk of aquaplaning on wet roads. The braking distance is longer than on dry surfaces. The vehicle in front creates a spray of dirty water that reduces your visibility. Also, you cannot see larger puddles of water in advance. To be able to react well to dangerous situations, keep a greater distance from the vehicle in front and adjust your speed.

#### Question 1.1.03-120

**Points:** 3 Points

**What is the correct course of action in this situation?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_03-120.png)

**Options:**
- A. I reduce my speed
- B. I avoid jerky steering movements
- C. I brake hard while in the bend

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I reduce my speed
- B. I avoid jerky steering movements

**Explanation:**
Drive carefully, slowly and avoid abrupt steering or braking, because slippery snow or ice can occur at any time.

---

#### Question 1.1.03-121

**Points:** 4 Points

**While driving, it suddenly begins to rain heavily. What should you do?**

**Options:**
- A. I reduce my speed
- B. I avoid strong acceleration
- C. I reduce the safety distance to the vehicle ahead

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I reduce my speed
- B. I avoid strong acceleration

**Explanation:**
Extra care should be taken when driving in heavy rain. This includes adjusting speed, increasing the safe distance and avoiding heavy acceleration, which creates a risk of slipping.

### 1.1.04 Chapter Darkness And Poor Visibility


#### Question 1.1.04-001

**Points:** 4 Points

**You turn from a brightly lit road into an unlit road. What do you have to bear in mind?**

**Options:**
- A. Eyes adapt only slowly to darkness
- B. Obstructions are harder to make out than before
- C. Your eyes have already adapted to the darkness when you turned off

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Eyes adapt only slowly to darkness
- B. Obstructions are harder to make out than before

**Explanation:**
Pupils are contracted in brightness and wide open in darkness. Immediately after turning from a bright road into a dark road, you will therefore find it even more difficult to see obstacles that are already difficult to see in the dark. Depending on your age, your eyes need more or less time to adjust to changing light conditions.

---

#### Question 1.1.04-103-B

**Points:** 4 Points

**What must you do in this situation when you are dazzled?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_04-103-B.png)

**Options:**
- A. Look to the right-hand edge of the roadway
- B. If necessary, reduce your speed
- C. Accelerate to get out of the beam of light more quickly

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Look to the right-hand edge of the roadway
- B. If necessary, reduce your speed

**Explanation:**
If you are dazzled by a high beam or incorrectly adjusted headlights, do not look into the cone of light but to the right edge of the road. As a precaution, reduce your speed so that you can still brake in time for pedestrians or cyclists.

---

#### Question 1.1.04-107

**Points:** 4 Points

**What must you be aware of here?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_04-107.png)

**Options:**
- A. That your vehicle will not be seen in time
- B. That you only detect oncoming vehicles after it is too late
- C. That the traffic lights are hardly distinct from the coloured signs

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. That your vehicle will not be seen in time
- B. That you only detect oncoming vehicles after it is too late
- C. That the traffic lights are hardly distinct from the coloured signs

**Explanation:**
The numerous neon signs distract from traffic and in particular from traffic lights. Due to the distraction other road users might see you too late and you might not see them in time as well. Hazardous situations can arise. Other road users might behave incorrectly because they do not recognize the traffic signs or recognize them when it's too late. Drive carefully and at an appropriate speed.

#### Question 1.1.04-108

**Points:** 4 Points

**Why might driving along this road become dangerous?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_04-108.png)

**Options:**
- A. Because persons on the road can be easily overlooked
- B. Because poorly lit vehicles can be difficult to detect
- C. Because oncoming vehicles will only be detected very late

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because persons on the road can be easily overlooked
- B. Because poorly lit vehicles can be difficult to detect

**Explanation:**
If you are on a lighted roadway with dark sections, you must pay particular attention to pedestrians who might cross the road. Parked vehicles in the aforementioned dark sections are also often not seen in time. Therefore, drive slowly and carefully. Oncoming vehicles, on the other hand, are usually easy to spot.

---

#### Question 1.1.04-109

**Points:** 4 Points

**Why is it possible that vehicle drivers do not take notice of the "Give way" sign?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_04-109.png)

**Options:**
- A. The continuous lighting gives rise to the assumption of having the right of way at the junction
- B. The layout of the road creates the impression of a priority road
- C. Parked vehicles partially conceal the intersection

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. The continuous lighting gives rise to the assumption of having the right of way at the junction
- B. The layout of the road creates the impression of a priority road
- C. Parked vehicles partially conceal the intersection

**Explanation:**
Even if the better lighting leads you to believe that you have priority over the less well-lit crossroads, you must observe the right of way. This is indicated by the corresponding sign at the intersection. This also doesn't change with the vehicles parked in the crossing area. That's why all three answers are correct.

---

#### Question 1.1.04-110

**Points:** 4 Points

**What must you watch out for when you drive into an underground car park?**

**Options:**
- A. My eyes need to adjust to the change in lighting conditions
- B. Pedestrians frequently walk on vehicle lanes
- C. My tyres could get damaged by narrow entrances and exits

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. My eyes need to adjust to the change in lighting conditions
- B. Pedestrians frequently walk on vehicle lanes
- C. My tyres could get damaged by narrow entrances and exits

**Explanation:**
When entering an underground car park, drivers are bothered by the change from daylight to moderate lighting in the interior. The pupils do not respond quickly enough to the lighting condition changes and therefore might not be able to detect obstacles or people in time. In addition, the entrances and exits are narrow and confusing. Drive slowly, with low beam and always ready for braking in an underground car park.

---

#### Question 1.1.04-111

**Points:** 3 Points

**What should you do in this kind of visibility?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_04-111.png)

**Options:**
- A. I reduce my speed
- B. I keep towards the right-hand edge of the carriageway
- C. I switch on my main beam lights

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I reduce my speed
- B. I keep towards the right-hand edge of the carriageway

**Explanation:**
In poor visibility conditions, you must first reduce your speed. If you are blinded by an oncoming vehicle, you should look to the right-hand side of the road so that you do not leave the road. You must not switch on your high beams here.

### 1.1.05 Chapter Speed


#### Question 1.1.05-001

**Points:** 4 Points

**Where does driving fast often lead to accidents?**

**Options:**
- A. At crossroads and junctions
- B. At pedestrian crossings
- C. On bends

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. At crossroads and junctions
- B. At pedestrian crossings
- C. On bends

**Explanation:**
Excessive speed is one of the main causes of accidents. The faster you drive, the longer your braking distance and the less time you have to react to other road users. At too high a speed, you can be carried out of the bend by centrifugal force. On slippery and wet roads, you lose traction and control of the car at high speed.

---

#### Question 1.1.05-002

**Points:** 4 Points

**Where is fast driving particularly dangerous?**

**Options:**
- A. At blind corners
- B. At road narrowings
- C. At level crossings

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. At blind corners
- B. At road narrowings
- C. At level crossings

**Explanation:**
In blind bends, fast driving is particularly dangerous because suddenly appearing obstacles are seen too late. High speed can also be dangerous at road narrowings, as there is not always enough braking distance available. Also, do not underestimate the risk of skidding due to uneven road surfaces at level crossings.

---

#### Question 1.1.05-003

**Points:** 4 Points

**How do you take tight bends?**

**Options:**
- A. Reduce speed before reaching the bend
- B. Only accelerate again when the road straightens out
- C. Reduce speed only when you reach the centre of the bend

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Reduce speed before reaching the bend
- B. Only accelerate again when the road straightens out

**Explanation:**
You should reduce your speed before entering a tight bend and only accelerate again when entering the straight, if visibility permits. Be aware that abrupt braking in a bend can cause your vehicle to skid.

#### Question 1.1.05-103

**Points:** 5 Points

**What must you be aware of?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_05-103.png)

[Video: videos/1_1_05-103.mp4](videos/1_1_05-103.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. Pedestrians could cross the road
- B. I may drive past the bus at walking speed
- C. I may not drive past the bus

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Pedestrians could cross the road
- B. I may drive past the bus at walking speed

**Explanation:**
You may only pass a bus at a bus stop with its hazard lights on at walking speed and with increased attention. Passengers may step out into the road in front of the bus or rush to catch it. They often do not pay attention to the traffic.

---

#### Question 1.1.05-105

**Points:** 5 Points

**What do you have to be aware of in this situation?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_05-105.png)

[Video: videos/1_1_05-105.mp4](videos/1_1_05-105.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. I look out for people who could walk onto the road
- B. I may only pass the bus at walking speed
- C. I may not drive past the bus

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I look out for people who could walk onto the road
- B. I may only pass the bus at walking speed

**Explanation:**
If a bus stops at a bus stop, you must always approach carefully. You have to stop behind the bus and you are only allowed to go past it at walking pace when you are sure you're not endangering anyone. The set hazard warning lights show: The stop is dangerous. This way, school buses warn from children who are getting off. They could suddenly come out in front of the bus and cross the lane or run to the bus to catch it.

#### Question 1.1.05-107-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**What must you be aware of here?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_05-107-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. Of vehicles speeding
- B. That junctions will not be noticed
- C. That children may run onto the road

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Of vehicles speeding
- B. That junctions will not be noticed
- C. That children may run onto the road

**Explanation:**
They are crossing a residential area. The road is wide and tempts them to drive fast. But be careful: playing children can suddenly jump onto the road. If you drive too fast, you will not be able to react and brake in time. You may also overlook crossroads or junctions. In residential areas, "right before left" often applies: you must give way to vehicles coming from the right.

### 1.1.06 Chapter Overtaking


#### Question 1.1.06-002

**Points:** 5 Points

**Is it irresponsible to overtake a truck and trailer a short distance before a crossroads?**

**Options:**
- A. Yes, because the truck and trailer can obscure the view of important traffic signs
- B. Yes, because the truck and trailer can obscure the view of the crossing traffic
- C. No, because trucks and trailers mostly drive at low speed

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Yes, because the truck and trailer can obscure the view of important traffic signs
- B. Yes, because the truck and trailer can obscure the view of the crossing traffic

**Explanation:**
Under no circumstances should you start an overtaking manoeuvre just before a crossing. There is an increased risk of accidents. This applies especially to overtaking trucks. You may not be able to see cross-traffic or traffic signs.

---

#### Question 1.1.06-005-M

**Points:** 5 Points

**Why are you not allowed to overtake now?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_06-005-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. Because [the cyclist] could turn off to the left
- B. Because I am not able to see possible oncoming traffic in good enough time
- C. Because of the very poor condition of the left-side road surface

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because [the cyclist] could turn off to the left
- B. Because I am not able to see possible oncoming traffic in good enough time

**Explanation:**
You are not allowed to overtake because the cyclist could turn and the oncoming traffic is not detected in time.

---

#### Question 1.1.06-103

**Points:** 5 Points

**What mistakes make overtaking dangerous even on clear and straight roads?**

**Options:**
- A. The distance of an oncoming vehicle is overestimated
- B. You underestimate your overtaking distance
- C. You overestimate your overtaking distance

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. The distance of an oncoming vehicle is overestimated
- B. You underestimate your overtaking distance

**Explanation:**
Overtaking maneuvers are dangerous even on straight and open roads. This is especially true if oncoming traffic approaches you. The speed of oncoming vehicles is difficult to assess. Often the duration of the overtaking maneuver is underestimated. If you take too long, dangerous situations for you and for others can arise. Before you start overtaking another vehicle, make sure that the opposite lane is clear and you can finish the overtaking maneuver quickly. Otherwise you wait.

---

#### Question 1.1.06-104

**Points:** 5 Points

**When are you in danger when overtaking?**

**Options:**
- A. - suddenly accelerates
- B. - swerves out to overtake
- C. - reduces his speed considerably

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - suddenly accelerates
- B. - swerves out to overtake

**Explanation:**
If you notice that the vehicle behind you wants to overtake you, do not increase your own speed under any circumstances. This prolongs the overtaking manoeuvre and can lead to dangerous situations. Before you start to overtake, make sure that the vehicle behind you is not about to overtake you. Otherwise they will have to brake heavily.

---

#### Question 1.1.06-105

**Points:** 5 Points

**In which cases must you abandon overtaking?**

**Options:**
- A. When the road user being overtaken suddenly accelerates
- B. When there is danger from unexpected oncoming traffic
- C. When the road user being overtaken considerably reduces his speed

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. When the road user being overtaken suddenly accelerates
- B. When there is danger from unexpected oncoming traffic

**Explanation:**
Sudden oncoming traffic requires that an overtaking manoeuvre be stopped immediately. The same applies if the vehicle to be overtaken accelerates. This means that you can no longer estimate the overtaking distance and endanger oncoming traffic if you continue. If the vehicle being overtaken reduces its speed, there is no danger.

---

#### Question 1.1.06-106

**Points:** 4 Points

**When is overtaking forbidden?**

**Options:**
- A. If you are unable to drive considerably faster than the road user being overtaken
- B. If you do not have a clear view of the road ahead
- C. If the traffic situation is not clear

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. If you are unable to drive considerably faster than the road user being overtaken
- B. If you do not have a clear view of the road ahead
- C. If the traffic situation is not clear

**Explanation:**
If you encounter an unclear traffic situation, overtaking is prohibited. This applies in particular:
- On bends
- On unclear stretches of road
- Immediately before and at junctions where the right of way is unclear
- When the traffic situation is unclear
- If you cannot judge exactly what the vehicle in front is doing.
- If it would take you too long to overtake because your vehicle is not fast enough.
Before overtaking, make sure that you do not endanger other road users and oncoming traffic.

---

#### Question 1.1.06-111

**Points:** 5 Points

**Why can it be dangerous to overtake even on clearly visible, straight roads?**

**Options:**
- A. - oncoming traffic is travelling faster than first thought
- B. - the overtaking distance is longer than first thought
- C. - oncoming traffic is travelling slower than first thought

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - oncoming traffic is travelling faster than first thought
- B. - the overtaking distance is longer than first thought

**Explanation:**
On a straight stretch of road, you may be able to see oncoming traffic from a distance, but often underestimate their speed. If an overtaking manoeuvre takes too long, dangerous situations can arise. If there is oncoming traffic, it is better to wait until the road is clear before overtaking.

**Options:**
- A. I abort the overtaking manoeuvre
- B. I perform the overtaking manoeuvre quickly
- C. I perform the overtaking manoeuvre cautiously

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I abort the overtaking manoeuvre

**Explanation:**
You just want to start overtaking the cyclist, when the blue car suddenly drives out of its parking space. Apparently, he has not noticed the cyclist yet. It might happen that the cyclist now moves to the left, without looking back. Immediately stop the overtaking maneuver to avoid endangering the cyclist.

- B. Oncoming traffic
- C. The cyclist will dismount to allow me to pass

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. The cyclist will drive past to the left of the parked car
- B. Oncoming traffic

**Explanation:**
Your lane is blocked by a stopped vehicle. You must swerve into the oncoming lane to get around it. Pay particular attention to oncoming traffic. The cyclist in front of you will also go around the obstacle and may not indicate this by hand signals.

#### Question 1.1.06-122

**Points:** 4 Points

**What should you anticipate, if you want to overtake?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_06-122.png)

**Options:**
- A. With the unsafe riding manner of the cyclist
- B. With an extended stopping distance
- C. With the risk of skidding

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. With the unsafe riding manner of the cyclist
- B. With an extended stopping distance
- C. With the risk of skidding

**Explanation:**
On snow-covered roads, the braking and stopping distance is longer and there is also an increased risk of slipping. Cyclists in particular have difficulty riding safely. Their risk of falling is significantly increased. Keep a greater distance from the cyclist, also because his stopping distance is very long.

#### Question 1.1.06-123

**Points:** 4 Points

**You want to overtake. What should you prepare yourself for?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_06-123.png)

**Options:**
- A. The cyclist will come to a sudden stop right in front of me
- B. The cyclist farther in front will swerve to the left
- C. Oncoming traffic will appear suddenly

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. The cyclist will come to a sudden stop right in front of me
- B. The cyclist farther in front will swerve to the left

**Explanation:**
A cyclist might shake as one-handed driving and the heavy load on the rack make his bike unstable. If the front cyclist turns around, it will likely make him swing to the left and take up more space than usual. You should only drive past the cyclists with a safe distance of at least two meters.

#### Question 1.1.06-124

**Points:** 5 Points

**You want to overtake cyclists on a narrow road. The width of the road means that the maximum possible space between them and the car is 50 cm. What should you do?**

**Options:**
- A. I refrain from overtaking
- B. I give a short warning signal before overtaking
- C. I overtake at a moderate speed

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I refrain from overtaking

**Explanation:**
To avoid danger, as a vehicle driver you must always keep a sufficient safety distance of at least 1.50 metres when overtaking cyclists. If it is not possible to pass the cyclist at such a distance, you must not overtake him under any circumstances.

#### Question 1.1.06-125

**Points:** 5 Points

**You want to overtake cyclists. What should be noted when selecting the distance between the cyclists and the car?**

**Options:**
- A. How the cyclists are acting
- B. The speed of my vehicle
- C. 1.0 m between the cyclist and the car is always sufficient

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. How the cyclists are acting
- B. The speed of my vehicle

**Explanation:**
If you want to overtake a cyclist, you must consider the following with regard to the lateral distance: The side distance must be at least 1.5 m, more if the cyclist's behaviour is conspicuous. The reasons for this are possible oscillating movements of the cyclist, but also the possible suction effect of your vehicle at higher speed. Honking as well as overtaking at a lower lateral distance are considered gross negligence.

#### Question 1.1.06-127-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**What is the right course of action?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_06-127-M.png)

[Video: videos/1_1_06-127-M.mp4](videos/1_1_06-127-M.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. - after the bend
- B. - before drawing level with the [truck]
- C. - between [truck] and bend

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - after the bend

**Explanation:**
The cyclist will overtake the lorry and pull out to do so. It is too dangerous to overtake him before the bend, as you may not yet be able to see oncoming vehicles. Only overtake the cyclist after the bend. As a general rule, you may only overtake if you can see that there is no danger to or obstruction of oncoming traffic during the entire overtaking process.

#### Question 1.1.06-130

**Points:** 5 Points

**Why can it be dangerous to overtake on an unobscured, straight road?**

**Options:**
- A. - estimate the distance away of an oncoming vehicle as being too great
- B. - estimate the speed of an oncoming vehicle as being too low
- C. - estimate my overtaking distance to be shorter than it is

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - estimate the distance away of an oncoming vehicle as being too great
- B. - estimate the speed of an oncoming vehicle as being too low
- C. - estimate my overtaking distance to be shorter than it is

**Explanation:**
If you misjudge the speed and distance of an oncoming vehicle, your overtaking distance is longer than expected. This can cause accidents.

#### Question 1.1.06-131-M

**Points:** 5 Points

**What is the right course of action now?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_06-131-M.png)

[Video: videos/1_1_06-131-M.mp4](videos/1_1_06-131-M.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. I reduce my speed
- B. I move to the right, onto the parking strip
- C. I maintain my current speed

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I reduce my speed

**Explanation:**
The vehicle overtaking you has estimated its overtaking path too short. You should reduce your speed so that the overtaking person can re-enter earlier and that the risk of an accident is reduced.

---

#### Question 1.1.06-201-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**Why may you not overtake in this situation?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_06-201-M.png)

[Video: videos/1_1_06-201-M.mp4](videos/1_1_06-201-M.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. Because the overtaking distance is obscured
- B. Because I am travelling only a little faster than the cyclists
- C. Because there is a no-overtaking sign

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because the overtaking distance is obscured
- B. Because I am travelling only a little faster than the cyclists

**Explanation:**
The overtaking lane is not visible due to the cyclists and the course of the road. If you cannot see the overtaking lane, you must not overtake. As you cannot go much faster than the cyclists, the overtaking lane becomes much longer and therefore more dangerous.

---

#### Question 1.1.06-202-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**Why are you not allowed to overtake now?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_06-202-M.png)

[Video: videos/1_1_06-202-M.mp4](videos/1_1_06-202-M.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. Because [the cyclist] could turn off to the left
- B. Because it will impede oncoming traffic
- C. Because there is a no-overtaking sign

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because [the cyclist] could turn off to the left

**Explanation:**
The cyclist swings to the left and looks over his shoulder. He will probably turn left. Reduce your speed to give the cyclist enough space and ensure that he does not feel pressurised. In this way, you will also avoid endangering the cyclist in the event of an abrupt braking manoeuvre and possible rear-end collisions due to a lack of distance.

### 1.1.07 Chapter Special Traffic Situations


#### Question 1.1.07-001

**Points:** 3 Points

**What must you be prepared for when a truck in front of you wishes to turn right into a narrow street?**

**Options:**
- A. - reduce speed drastically
- B. - swing out to the left before turning
- C. - move well over to the right

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - reduce speed drastically
- B. - swing out to the left before turning

**Explanation:**
Keep a large distance from the lorry and under no circumstances overtake on the right-hand side, even if you would have the opportunity to do so as a two-wheeler driver. The road train must first reduce its speed considerably to turn. For reasons of space, the truck driver may then have to steer the towing vehicle far to the left so that the trailer or semi-trailer does not roll over the kerb when turning.

---

#### Question 1.1.07-002

**Points:** 3 Points

**What do you have to particularly remember at crossroads and junctions in a built-up area?**

**Options:**
- A. Intersecting roads may have priority even though they are narrow and less well developed
- B. A better developed road always has priority
- C. The rule "right before left" applies without exception at all crossroads and junctions

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Intersecting roads may have priority even though they are narrow and less well developed

**Explanation:**
By driving on a wide and well-developed road, you don't automatically have the right of way. The rule "right before left" does not apply always and everywhere. Instead, signs or traffic lights regulate who has priority. Therefore, pay attention to the signposted right-of-way regulation or the traffic lights at each individual intersection and junction.

---

#### Question 1.1.07-005-B

**Points:** 3 Points

**What must you be prepared for?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_07-005-B.png)

**Options:**
- A. The appearance of a vehicle from the right
- B. A longer braking distance on account of the wet, leaf-covered road
- C. A vehicle coming from the right will give way despite having priority

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. The appearance of a vehicle from the right
- B. A longer braking distance on account of the wet, leaf-covered road

**Explanation:**
The wet leaves on the road significantly increase the braking distance of your vehicle. Adjust your speed accordingly. Also keep in mind that due to the non-existent priority traffic signs, the "Left yields to right" rule applies. You would have to give priority to a vehicle coming from the right, even if the driver is slow and hesitant to approach the intersection due to the weather.

---

#### Question 1.1.07-006-B

**Points:** 3 Points

**Why must you be particularly careful here?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_07-006-B.png)

**Options:**
- A. Because there is an increased danger of skidding when braking
- B. Because a vehicle could come from the right
- C. Because the car coming from the left has priority

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because there is an increased danger of skidding when braking
- B. Because a vehicle could come from the right

**Explanation:**
The wet leaves on the road result in a longer braking distance and a high risk of slipping. Therefore, reduce your speed and drive carefully before reaching the intersection. A vehicle could be coming from the right and you should give it the right of way. Since there are no signs at the intersection that give you the right of way, the rule here is "right before left".

#### Question 1.1.07-008

**Points:** 3 Points

**You want to pull out of a row of parked vehicles into the stream of moving traffic. Behind you is a parked truck and trailer. How do you assess this situation?**

**Options:**
- A. Because of your restricted view, you cannot see approaching vehicles until they are very close
- B. Because of their restricted view, vehicles approaching from behind cannot see your vehicle until very late
- C. It is safe to pull out here because you are protected by the truck and trailer behind you

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because of your restricted view, you cannot see approaching vehicles until they are very close
- B. Because of their restricted view, vehicles approaching from behind cannot see your vehicle until very late

**Explanation:**
Because of the truck, you can hardly see the traffic behind you. It also obscures the view of the flowing traffic on your vehicle. You must therefore be particularly careful and slowly feel your way on the road. You may need to go back to avoid hazards.

- B. - ride their bicycles onto the road without paying attention
- C. - always conduct themselves properly on the road

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - rush onto the road without thinking
- B. - ride their bicycles onto the road without paying attention

**Explanation:**
In the vicinity of schools, you must always be prepared for children crossing the road abruptly. Children are not yet able to assess themselves and other road users very well and often react impulsively and in a way that is not appropriate for traffic. As a car driver, you must adapt your driving style accordingly in order to exclude any danger to children. In addition to driving at a low speed, you must be particularly attentive and ready to brake at all times.

**Options:**
- A. - will swing far out to the left when turning
- B. - will slow down drastically before turning
- C. - cannot swing out due to rear-wheel steering

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - will swing far out to the left when turning
- B. - will slow down drastically before turning

**Explanation:**
The combine harvester needs to gain amplitude to turn because the turn is very narrow. To do this, it will greatly reduce his speed. Keep your distance and also drive slowly and be prepared to brake. Especially for cyclists: Never overtake on the right!

#### Question 1.1.07-013

**Points:** 4 Points

**You are driving behind a farm vehicle with a trailer carrying a high load. What must you reckon with?**

**Options:**
- A. Particularly when braking or turning, parts of the load can fall off
- B. The indicators may be concealed, making it difficult to see when the combination of vehicles wishes to turn off
- C. The braking distance of the combination of vehicles is particularly short because of its load

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Particularly when braking or turning, parts of the load can fall off
- B. The indicators may be concealed, making it difficult to see when the combination of vehicles wishes to turn off

**Explanation:**
If you are riding behind an agricultural vehicle with a heavily loaded trailer, you must expect the following: Part of the load could fall onto the roadway when turning or braking. The indicator could be dirty or covered by the load. The braking distance of the vehicle is increased by the weight of the load.

- C. That I will have to stop at the junction

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Pedestrians crossing the road
- B. A vehicle driving past the bus
- C. That I will have to stop at the junction

**Explanation:**
You must expect to have to stop before the intersection when turning. For one thing, the view of the bus coming from the right is obstructed. In addition, other vehicles could pass it. In addition, pedestrians may also want to cross the road. You must always show special consideration for them.

[Video: videos/1_1_07-017.mp4](videos/1_1_07-017.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. - pull out and cross the centre of the road
- B. - brake and not cross the centre of the road
- C. - overtake without crossing the centre of the road

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - pull out and cross the centre of the road

**Explanation:**
Because the oncoming vehicle is being slowed down by a bicycle, you should expect the vehicle to overtake the bicycle. If this happens, the vehicle could cross into your lane. In the event that the driver does not brake, you should keep as far to the right on the road as possible. Also, be prepared to brake so that you can react to any situation as quickly as possible.

#### Question 1.1.07-019-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**You want to turn right at the junction. What is the right thing to do?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_07-019-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. I change lanes as early as possible
- B. I may not impede cyclists in the cycle lane
- C. I may only cross over the cycle lane at walking speed

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I change lanes as early as possible
- B. I may not impede cyclists in the cycle lane

**Explanation:**
There is a protective lane for cyclists between your lane and the turning lane. It is part of the carriageway and is separated by a broken line.
You may only use the protective lane to change lanes, swerve or turn. If you use it, you are not allowed to obstruct cyclists or come to a standstill in the protective lane. You should therefore change lanes as early as possible.

#### Question 1.1.07-023

**Points:** 3 Points

**What should you note about electric bicycles (e-bikes) participating in road traffic?**

**Options:**
- A. - be deceptively fast
- B. - look very similar to conventional bicycles
- C. - be easily recognised due to their engine noise

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - be deceptively fast
- B. - look very similar to conventional bicycles

**Explanation:**
E-bikes are just as quiet as classic bikes and are therefore often perceived late. However, they often achieve significantly higher speeds than bicycles without an engine. This is underestimated by many road users, so dangerous situations can occur surprisingly. In general, expect cyclists to gain speed and perform speedy maneuvers.

#### Question 1.1.07-101

**Points:** 4 Points

**You wish to overtake a farm tractor with a mounted implement extending beyond its back. What must you remember?**

**Options:**
- A. The mounted implement can swing out when the tractor turns off
- B. The rear lights may be heavily soiled or concealed, making direction signals difficult or impossible to see when they are on
- C. Farm tractors can always be overtaken safely due to their low speed

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. The mounted implement can swing out when the tractor turns off
- B. The rear lights may be heavily soiled or concealed, making direction signals difficult or impossible to see when they are on

**Explanation:**
You should always refrain from an overtaking maneuver when the tractor wants to turn. The reason for this is that the tractor has a large turning circle and is likely to veer, blocking the road. Also keep in mind that the turn signals of such a vehicle are not always visible and that they could be covered by dirt due to the agricultural use.

#### Question 1.1.07-111

**Points:** 4 Points

**You are waiting at a traffic light and want to turn right. What should you remember?**

**Options:**
- A. - make sure there is no road user beside you on the right intending to go straight on
- B. - simply glance in the mirror to check that there is no cyclist behind you
- C. - concentrate fully on the turning manoeuvre because any cyclist has to wait anyway

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - make sure there is no road user beside you on the right intending to go straight on

**Explanation:**
If other road users are next to you, you must give priority to them if you wish to drive straight ahead. So, also pay attention to people on bike and pedestrian paths. It is not enough to just keep track of the road through the rear-view mirror. In addition, you have to control your surroundings with a look back over your shoulder to be able to perceive those road users who are hidden in the blind spot of the mirror.

#### Question 1.1.07-123

**Points:** 4 Points

**What must you observe particularly when driving through a tunnel?**

**Options:**
- A. You may be distracted by very loud noise

- C. You may be distracted by light effects

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. You may be distracted by very loud noise
- B. Signs for safety installations such as emergency exits and emergency telephones
- C. You may be distracted by light effects

**Explanation:**
Driving noises in a tunnel are considerably louder due to the reverberation of the tunnel walls. You can also hear the noise of the ventilation system. This has an irritating effect on you as a driver. Your eyes first have to get used to the different visibility conditions. The increased light reflections from oncoming traffic make things more difficult. The emergency signage is also distracting.

#### Question 1.1.07-139

**Points:** 3 Points

**Ahead of the motorbike a car is seeking to reverse on the road. What should you anticipate?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_07-139.png)

**Options:**
- A. That the car continues to reverse
- B. That the motorbike will suddenly brake
- C. That my braking distance will be longer than normal

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. That the car continues to reverse
- B. That the motorbike will suddenly brake
- C. That my braking distance will be longer than normal

**Explanation:**
Car drivers often underestimate the speed of approaching motorcyclists; the same happens to the driver here while he's pulling out of a parking space. The action alternatives of the motorcyclist - braking or dodging - are both dangerous for him on a snow-slicked road surface. He could fall. Also consider the longer braking distance in this weather.

#### Question 1.1.07-140

**Points:** 3 Points

**You are driving quickly along a main road and some distance ahead you see a deer close to the carriageway. What should you do?**

**Options:**
- A. - reduce speed
- B. - be ready to brake
- C. - perform an emergency braking manoeuvre

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - reduce speed
- B. - be ready to brake

**Explanation:**
If the deer is not yet on the road, you should under no circumstances perform emergency braking. This would unnecessarily endanger other road users and force them to unpredictable reactions. Nevertheless, you should reduce the speed of your vehicle and keep it ready to brake: the animal could run without warning on the road.

#### Question 1.1.07-141

**Points:** 4 Points

**Why are you particularly at risk, if you are riding a two-wheeler?**

**Options:**
- A. Because I can be easily overlooked
- B. Because my speed can be underestimated
- C. Because I am at greater risk of injury in the event of an accident

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because I can be easily overlooked
- B. Because my speed can be underestimated
- C. Because I am at greater risk of injury in the event of an accident

**Explanation:**
Especially in restrictive visibility conditions such as fog and darkness, the small silhouette of the two-wheeled driver leads to the fact that he is recognized late or not at all. In addition, the small design makes it difficult to estimate its speed. In the event of a collision, two-wheelers generally offer less protection than most other motor vehicles.

#### Question 1.1.07-142

**Points:** 3 Points

**Driving on a very busy road with several lanes, you have manoeuvred yourself into the lane for taking a left turn. Now instead of turning left, you want to turn right. What should you do?**

**Options:**
- A. I turn left
- B. I reverse with my hazard lights turned on
- C. Driving a wide curve, I turn right

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I turn left

**Explanation:**
A lane change or turning right could endanger other road users due to the heavy traffic. You must therefore turn left and take a small detour. Watch out for lane markings that prohibit you from changing lanes.

- B. For the bicycle
- C. For the motorbike

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. For the vehicle on the road ahead
- B. For the bicycle

**Explanation:**
You want to turn right, so does the car driver in front of you. The pedestrian traffic light of the cross street into which you want to turn shows green, and the pedestrian has priority. It is possible that your car in front will pull up and stop soon after to let the pedestrian pass. On the right you can also see a cyclist. The cyclist could drive past your vehicle on the right and circle your turning vehicle on the left. Avoid this danger.

**What is the right course of action now?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_07-150.png)

[Video: videos/1_1_07-150.mp4](videos/1_1_07-150.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. I keep a tight hold of the steering wheel and keep it pointed straight ahead
- B. I swerve to the left
- C. I swerve to the right

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I keep a tight hold of the steering wheel and keep it pointed straight ahead

**Explanation:**
When an animal walks on the road from the right, an evasive maneuver is a natural reflex. However, this can have far more fatal consequences than keeping the track. An evasive maneuver to the right may lead into the roadside ditch, one to the left may lead to a collision with oncoming traffic. It's safest to continue straight ahead.

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I perform an emergency braking manoeuvre
- B. I sound my horn

**Explanation:**
You can see that the animal is about to run on the road. Horns may help stop it. In addition, you should initiate emergency braking to reduce a potential collision. Do not dodge! This rather leads to accidents with personal injury than a collision with an animal.

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. For [the pedestrian]
- B. For the motorbike

**Explanation:**
While you wait at the red light, a motorcyclist pushes past the waiting vehicles. When the traffic light switches to green you should pay attention to the motorcyclist and let him pass before he initiates a risky overtaking maneuver. But you should also let the pedestrian cross the road, which is still on the road despite it being green.

#### Question 1.1.07-153-M

**Points:** 3 Points

**What must you be prepared for in this situation?**

![Question Image](images/1_1_07-153-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. That oncoming traffic will appear
- B. That the truck driver will jump down onto the carriageway
- C. That traffic signs are concealed behind the truck

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. That oncoming traffic will appear
- B. That the truck driver will jump down onto the carriageway
- C. That traffic signs are concealed behind the truck

**Explanation:**
The truck blocks your view. You can therefore recognize neither the oncoming traffic nor traffic signs behind the truck. Approach the vehicle at low speed. Look for oncoming traffic (they have priority) and keep your distance to the open driver's door when driving around. The driver of the truck could suddenly get out and jump onto the road.

- C. I am the first to cross over the junction

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I allow the [red] vehicle to turn
- B. I allow the electric scooter to cross the road

**Explanation:**
You are coming from a priority road first. As there are no other traffic signs, right is before left. The red car is driving on your right and therefore has the right of way. 
The electric scooter does not have right of way, so to avoid an accident you should let it cross anyway.

### 1.2.03 Chapter Speed


#### Question 1.2.03-001

**Points:** 4 Points

**Which factors lengthen your braking distance?**

**Options:**
- A. Towing a trailer not fitted with brakes
- B. A wet or slippery roadway
- C. Driving down slopes

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Towing a trailer not fitted with brakes
- B. A wet or slippery roadway
- C. Driving down slopes

**Explanation:**
The braking distance of a vehicle is extended: 1. on a steep hill, 2. on a wet or slippery road surface, 3. if the vehicle has to carry an additional load. The reasons for the extended braking distances are: On a steep hill, acceleration force is caused by gravity. On wet or slippery roads, the static friction between tires and road surface is reduced. Additional load increases the mass that needs to come to a stop.

#### Question 1.2.05-122

**Points:** 4 Points

**You are driving a slow-moving vehicle on a rural road. A line of vehicles is forming behind you. What should you do?**

**Options:**
- A. I allow the vehicles behind me to overtake
- B. I come to a stop at a suitable place, if this is the only way the vehicles behind me can overtake
- C. I switch on my hazard lights and drive as far to the right as possible

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I allow the vehicles behind me to overtake
- B. I come to a stop at a suitable place, if this is the only way the vehicles behind me can overtake

**Explanation:**
A long queue behind a slow-moving vehicle leads to dangerous overtaking maneuvers. To make overtaking easier for the vehicles jamming behind you, reduce your speed. If the queue still does not disappear, you may need to stop on a side strip. This does not apply to highways! You must not use the hazard lights.

**Options:**
- A. I change lanes just before the narrowing of the road
- B. I move into the right-hand lane now

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I change lanes just before the narrowing of the road

**Explanation:**
If a lane ends, vehicles should only merge into the lane right before the beginning of the constriction. This should be done alternately: Each vehicle from the continuing lane lets a vehicle from the ending lane go into the lane. This is called zipper merging. Practically, vehicles often go into the lane themselves too early out of fear of not being let in, thus narrowing the lane earlier than necessary.

#### Question 1.2.09-120

**Points:** 4 Points

**You want to turn left. In what sequence do you prepare to take the left turn?**

**Options:**
- A. Observe traffic behind you, indicate the direction of turn, enter the lane
- B. Indicate the direction of turn, enter the lane, observe traffic behind you
- C. Enter the lane, indicate the direction of turn, observe traffic behind you

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Observe traffic behind you, indicate the direction of turn, enter the lane

**What is the right course of action?**

![Question Image](images/1_2_09-121.png)

**Options:**
- A. I have to wait at the stop line
- B. I have to allow the cyclist to pass through
- C. I may make the turn in front of the cyclist

#### Question 1.2.09-124

**Points:** 3 Points

**You want to turn left. What difficulties could arise here?**

**Options:**
- A. Visibility restrictions caused by oncoming vehicles
- B. Misunderstandings with oncoming traffic turning left
- C. Traffic turning left can come dangerously close

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Visibility restrictions caused by oncoming vehicles
- B. Misunderstandings with oncoming traffic turning left
- C. Traffic turning left can come dangerously close

**Explanation:**
When turning left, vehicles approaching each other have to turn in front of each other (tangent turning). This can lead to poor visibility of the straight-ahead traffic. Especially left-turning trucks can lead to massive obstructions and make it safer to turn in a wide arc (turning behind each other). There may be misunderstandings between drivers when one wants to turn behind and the other in front.

- C. Speed up and proceed since the oncoming traffic must wait

**Correct Answer(s):**

---

#### Question 1.2.11-006

**Points:** 4 Points

**During traffic congestion, what parts of the road infrastructure must be kept clear?**

**Options:**
- A. Traffic confluences
- B. Pedestrian crossings
- C. Bus stops

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Traffic confluences
- B. Pedestrian crossings

**Explanation:**
The pedestrian crossing (“zebra crossing”) is intended to enable pedestrians to cross the road safely and without danger. For this reason, you must leave pedestrian crossings free under all circumstances. If you drive into a junction (or crossing) in slow-moving traffic, there is a risk that you will block oncoming cross traffic or that oncoming traffic turning left will have to wait unnecessarily long. The junction or crossing would thus become even more clogged and traffic would be obstructed more than necessary.

#### Question 1.2.11-007-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**You want to continue driving straight ahead. What is correct in this situation?**

![Question Image](images/1_2_11-007-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. I allow the convoy to pass through
- B. I wait at the stop line
- C. I cross over the junction

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I allow the convoy to pass through
- B. I wait at the stop line

**Explanation:**
A group of pedestrians, cyclists or motor vehicles, which is traveling together in road traffic, is called a closed association. Closed associations must be clearly marked and must not be interrupted.
So you have to wait until all vehicles drove past you and as long as you have to wait at the stop line.

#### Question 1.2.11-103-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**You want to continue driving straight ahead. What is the right course of action?**

![Question Image](images/1_2_11-103-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. I remain waiting in my lane
- B. I move to the right if there is sufficient space in the traffic
- C. I overtake the vehicle alongside me and switch lanes

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I remain waiting in my lane
- B. I move to the right if there is sufficient space in the traffic

**Explanation:**
The car ahead blocks you in your lane. Nevertheless, you should not overtake on the right before the intersection, as this would be too dangerous. Keep your distance, reduce the speed and stop if necessary. Continue straight ahead when the free lane is free and the traffic light turns green. You can only change on the right lane if there is a sufficiently large traffic gap.

#### Question 1.2.11-108

**Points:** 4 Points

**In which situations are you not allowed to enter a junction even though the traffic light is green?**

**Options:**
- A. If I would have to stop in the middle of the junction because the traffic is backing up
- B. If asked to stop by a police officer
- C. If the sign "Stop. Give way" is displayed at the junction

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. If I would have to stop in the middle of the junction because the traffic is backing up
- B. If asked to stop by a police officer

**Explanation:**
In the following cases, you must not enter a crossroad, even though the traffic light shows "green": with slow-moving traffic, as crossings, for example, must remain free for emergency vehicles. Secondly, when police officers regulate traffic and give instructions that deviate from the meanings of the colors of the traffic lights. In general, a green traffic light tells you that you are allowed to drive and overrules other traffic signs that regulate the right of way. Policeman orders have the highest rank and override traffic lights.

#### Question 1.2.11-109

**Points:** 4 Points

**In what instances may you not enter a junction, even though you have right of way?**

**Options:**
- A. - would have to wait in the junction because the traffic in my direction is backing up
- B. - would impede a vehicle with flashing blue lights and siren
- C. - want to turn left and would have to wait in the junction because of oncoming traffic

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - would have to wait in the junction because the traffic in my direction is backing up
- B. - would impede a vehicle with flashing blue lights and siren

**Explanation:**
If the traffic slows down, you may enter a crossroad with a green traffic light or right of way only if you can leave it quickly without blocking it. This is particularly important in order to keep the intersection free for police, fire and ambulance emergency vehicles. If you hear a siren, you have to drive carefully to the crossroad and may only continue if you hinder no emergency vehicle. When turning left, you must slowly enter the intersection and wait there until you can drive freely without oncoming traffic.

### 1.2.12 Chapter Stopping And Parking


#### Question 1.2.12-001

**Points:** 3 Points

**Where is stopping prohibited?**

**Options:**
- A. On level crossings
- B. On narrow sections of the road and at blind spots
- C. Immediately behind pedestrian crossings

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. On level crossings
- B. On narrow sections of the road and at blind spots

**Explanation:**
A "stop" is when a vehicle stops for less than 3 minutes for reasons unrelated to traffic without the driver getting out of the vehicle. If the driver stops for a longer time and/or leaves his vehicle, this is called parking. However, drivers are not allowed to stop everywhere so as not to endanger other road users.
Exceptions are:
- Non-stop zones
- Transitions through levels as there is a risk of collision with the train
- Narrow and incomprehensible places with a clearance width of less than 3 m
blind turns
- Hilltops
- Pedestrian crossings and the area in front of them (distance not less than 5 m), but not the area behind them.

[Video: videos/1_2_37-022-M.mp4](videos/1_2_37-022-M.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. I continue driving, ready to brake because the traffic lights could change to “amber”

#### Question 1.4.42-104

**Points:** 3 Points

**What is allowed on priority roads outside built-up areas?**

![Question Image](images/1_4_42-104.png)

**Options:**
- A. Stopping on the right edge of the roadway
- B. Parking on the hard shoulder
- C. Parking on the roadway

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Stopping on the right edge of the roadway
- B. Parking on the hard shoulder

**Explanation:**
On priority roads outside of built-up areas, you may: 1. wait at the right side of the road; 2. park on a hard shoulder. On the other hand, parking on the road is prohibited. Parking vehicles constitute a hindrance and/or danger to flowing traffic, since vehicles are traveling much faster here than within the closed local area. Since a hard shoulder is not considered a lane, you may use it for parking. If there is a possibility to dodge on a hard shoulder, you should also use this for waiting shortly.

## Theme 1.5. Environmental Protection


### 1.5.01 Chapter Environmental Protection


#### Question 1.5.01-001

**Points:** 3 Points

**What must you remember in the interests of environmental protection?**

**Options:**
- A. To avoid running the engine unnecessarily when you are stationary
- B. To avoid driving back and forth unnecessarily
- C. To drive with high revolutions per minute too often

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. To avoid running the engine unnecessarily when you are stationary
- B. To avoid driving back and forth unnecessarily

**Explanation:**
In the interests of environmental protection, you as a car driver must pay attention to the following: 1. Avoid driving unnecessarily; 2. Operate the engine evenly at medium speed; 3. Shut off the engine during extended periods of idling - after about a minute. In general, running the engine at idle will result in faster engine wear and wastes energy. You should therefore warm the engine in medium speed range and possibly stay in this area. High engine speeds lead to increased fuel consumption and therefore pollute the environment.

---

#### Question 1.5.01-003

**Points:** 3 Points

**What must be regularly serviced to prevent high fuel consumption and excessive pollutant emission?**

**Options:**
- A. Engine air filter
- B. Carburettor or fuel-injection system
- C. Ignition system

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Engine air filter
- B. Carburettor or fuel-injection system
- C. Ignition system

**Explanation:**
The fuel consumption of a vehicle should be as low as possible. As a car driver, you should therefore regularly check and maintain all the components of your vehicle that are important for fuel consumption. These are, for example, the ignition and injection system and the engine air filter and the carburetor.

---

#### Question 1.5.01-004

**Points:** 3 Points

**What happens as a result of tyre pressures being well below the recommended levels?**

**Options:**
- A. Fuel consumption increases
- B. Tyre wear increases
- C. Pollutant emission decreases

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Fuel consumption increases
- B. Tyre wear increases

**Explanation:**
Too low air pressure in the tire as well leads to increased fuel consumption. The effort required to keep the tire running is significantly higher than when the tire pressure has been set correctly. This leads to higher wear on the tire, increased fuel consumption and harms the environment.

---

#### Question 1.5.01-005

**Points:** 3 Points

**When should you switch off the engine to save fuel and reduce pollution?**

**Options:**
- A. When you have to wait in a traffic jam for a long time
- B. When you have to wait at level crossings or building sites
- C. When you stop at a "STOP" sign

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. When you have to wait in a traffic jam for a long time
- B. When you have to wait at level crossings or building sites

**Explanation:**
In order to avoid unnecessary consumption of gasoline, the engine should be switched off in certain situations. These include, for example, moments in traffic jams or in front of level crossings. Although there is an increased consumption during starting, it is compensated again starting from a downtime of one minute. You should not turn off the engine at a stop sign.

#### Question 1.5.01-007

**Points:** 3 Points

**What must you remember when refuelling?**

**Options:**
- A. Do not breath in any fuel fumes
- B. Do not refuel when the tank is full and the nozzle has switched off
- C. Fill up to the brim if possible

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Do not breath in any fuel fumes
- B. Do not refuel when the tank is full and the nozzle has switched off

**Explanation:**
Inhaling fuel vapors is harmful to your health. Therefore, make sure that the dispenser is being used correctly and pay attention to any defects when refueling. When the tank is full, the automatic system should be switched off. This prevents the overflow of gasoline or diesel. In addition, some air must remain in the tank for the fuel to expand.

#### Question 1.5.01-008

**Points:** 3 Points

**The engine and exhaust system of a vehicle have been "souped up". What could be the effects?**

**Options:**
- A. Increased noise pollution
- B. Increased pollutant emission
- C. Considerable reduction in fuel consumption

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Increased noise pollution
- B. Increased pollutant emission

**Explanation:**
A souped-up engine and muffler provide increased noise pollution. In addition, the vehicle consumes more fuel. On top of that, exhaust emissions are increased and pollute the environment. In the worst case, the driver can expect a withdrawal of the operating license.

---

#### Question 1.5.01-009

**Points:** 3 Points

**How can you reduce the noise made by a car?**

**Options:**
- A. By driving at a low engine speed
- B. By using all-terrain tyres
- C. By removing the air filter

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. By driving at a low engine speed

**Explanation:**
In the low-speed speed range, the engine runs quieter than in high-revving areas. Deep-tread tires and driving without air filters also cause noise pollution. A driving style predominantly in the low-speed range saves fuel, is environmentally friendly and quiet. The minimum speeds must, however, be met, otherwise the engine runs twitchy, is cogging and sputtering. The lower the speed at which the engine is still running without cogging, the lower the noise.

#### Question 1.5.01-011

**Points:** 3 Points

**How can you drive fuel-efficiently when travelling at a constant speed?**

**Options:**
- A. By using cruise control
- B. By driving at a low engine speed
- C. By driving at a high engine speed

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. By using cruise control
- B. By driving at a low engine speed

**Explanation:**
At constant speed, you can save fuel with the following measures: 1. by driving evenly in the low speed range; 2. by using the cruise control. The low speed range is just above the minimum speed that the engine needs for its optimal performance. If you drive below that, the engine is cogging; if you drive over it the fuel consumption increases in the high-speed range due to the engine performance. With steady driving in the low-speed speed range, the engine runs smoothly and with low fuel consumption. Cruise control allows a uniform driving style and relieves the / the car driver.

#### Question 1.5.01-012

**Points:** 3 Points

**At which engine speed range will fuel consumption be lower?**

**Options:**
- A. At low engine speed
- B. At high engine speed

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. At low engine speed

**Explanation:**
An engine consumes the least fuel in the speed range just above the minimum speed. This is the so-called low-speed speed range. When driving in the low-speed range, the speed should always be above the idle speed. An engine below the minimum speed runs twitchy, is cogging, sputtering or turns off. As a rule of thumb, the lower the speed at which the engine runs without cogging, the more fuel can be saved.

#### Question 1.5.01-115

**Points:** 3 Points

**What can you do to help protect the environment?**

**Options:**
- A. - driving short distances
- B. - driving at flat-out speed
- C. - driving in crowded city centres

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - driving short distances
- B. - driving at flat-out speed
- C. - driving in crowded city centres

**Explanation:**
The best way to protect the environment is to drive less. All journeys that are not absolutely necessary should be avoided. Certain driving styles consume extra fuel: Short-distance driving, especially when the engine is still cold, stop-and-go traffic, for example in crowded inner cities and searching for a parking space. On top of that, in areas with heavy traffic, the risk of smog from the exhaust emissions of vehicles increases. Driving at full throttle will not only cause noise, but your fuel consumption will increase disproportionately. However, once you are only 20% below the maximum speed, you reduce your fuel consumption by about 40%. Carpooling is also good for the environment.

#### Question 1.5.01-116

**Points:** 3 Points

**How can you achieve efficient fuel consumption and low pollutant emissions?**

**Options:**
- A. By having the proper tyre pressure
- B. By maintaining an even driving style at low engine speeds
- C. By using the total capacity of every gear

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. By having the proper tyre pressure
- B. By maintaining an even driving style at low engine speeds

**Explanation:**
Before you drive off, you should make sure that the correct tire pressure is set. All important information about this topic can be found in the operating instructions of your vehicle. If the tire internal pressure is too high or too low, there will be an increase in pollutant emissions. Even unbalanced driving can lead to high fuel consumption. Therefore, instead of accelerating to the upper rotational speed limit and only change gears then, you should shift up in the lower or middle rotational speed limit range. This means you consume less fuel and at the same time reduce the exhaust emissions of your car.

#### Question 1.5.01-119

**Points:** 3 Points

**What should you do after starting the vehicle?**

**Options:**
- A. - drive off as promptly as possible
- B. - drive at low engine speeds where possible
- C. - if possible, allow the engine of the stationary vehicle to warm up

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - drive off as promptly as possible
- B. - drive at low engine speeds where possible

**Explanation:**
After starting the car, you should drive off directly in the low-speed range. Warming up the engine while standing is prohibited and wastes fuel. In the low-speed range, the engine can be warmed up gently. Driving at high-revving directly is not good for the engine. Generally, the engine consumes more fuel at high speed. At too low speeds, the engine is cogging and sputtering. The consumption of an engine is the lowest just above the minimum speed.

#### Question 1.5.01-120

**Points:** 3 Points

**How can you save fuel?**

**Options:**
- A. - removing any non-essential roof boxes etc
- B. - driving in a foresighted manner
- C. - driving with winter tyres the whole year round

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - removing any non-essential roof boxes etc
- B. - driving in a foresighted manner

**Explanation:**
You can save fuel by: 1. driving smoothly and anticipatory while avoiding high engine speeds; 2. remove unused roof structures, as they increase fuel consumption with air resistance; 3. swap winter tires for summer tires in the warm season. Driving smoothly means avoiding unnecessary acceleration and deceleration. For example, by slowly rolling toward a red light, you can use the rest of the momentum to drive on if it is already green when you reach the traffic light. Only having to give gas, saves fuel compared to starting from standing completely still.

#### Question 1.5.01-121

**Points:** 3 Points

**How can you minimise tyre wear?**

**Options:**
- A. I refrain as much as possible from rapid acceleration
- B. I regularly check the tyre inflation pressure
- C. I use winter tyres all year round

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I refrain as much as possible from rapid acceleration
- B. I regularly check the tyre inflation pressure

**Explanation:**
Driving with winter tires in non-winter weather leads to increased tire wear. Strong acceleration is associated with increased abrasion. The tire pressure recommended by the vehicle manufacturer must be observed. Too little tire pressure increases the tire wear considerably. If the air pressure is too low, the tire will deform more with each rotation than with correct tire pressure. Thereby the fabric layers of the tires rub against each other. Heat can be generated that irreparably damages the tire.

#### Question 2.1.01-001

**Points:** 3 Points

**What can cause skidding on bends?**

**Options:**
- A. Faulty shock-absorbers
- B. Insufficient or uneven tyre pressure
- C. Load is too small

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Faulty shock-absorbers
- B. Insufficient or uneven tyre pressure

**Explanation:**
Defective shock absorbers can be the cause of a vehicle skidding or swinging off the curve when turning. The correct tire pressure specified by the manufacturer is important for a stable vehicle position in curves. It is tailored to the overall design of the vehicle. Too low or too different tire pressure reduces driving stability and increases the risk of skidding on turns. Too high a load has an influence on the driving stability. There is not too little loading.

#### Question 2.1.01-003

**Points:** 3 Points

**What can cause skidding on bends?**

**Options:**
- A. Heavy braking
- B. Driving fast on a wet roadway
- C. Slight acceleration when leaving the bend

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Heavy braking
- B. Driving fast on a wet roadway

**Explanation:**
In curves, the following factors can lead to skidding: 1. excessive speed; 2. wet or icy roads; 3. strong braking. In turns, much of the stiction forces are needed for the cornering forces that hold the vehicle in the lane. If you brake too much, the stiction is instead used largely for the transmission of the braking force. As a result, the cornering forces are too low to counteract the centrifugal force, the same applies to excessive speed. On wet roads, a film of water between the road surface and the tire reduces grip and promotes skidding.

[Video: videos/2_1_01-007-M.mp4](videos/2_1_01-007-M.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. I reduce my speed so that the overtaking vehicle can pull in ahead of me
- B. I accelerate so that the overtaking vehicle can pull in behind me
- C. I maintain my speed because there is sufficient safety distance

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I reduce my speed so that the overtaking vehicle can pull in ahead of me

**Explanation:**
The overtaking vehicle will probably not be able to complete its overtaking manoeuvre as planned. To prevent an accident, you should let the overtaking vehicle get into the lane.

#### Question 2.1.01-008-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**Why should you allow the truck to change lane?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_01-008-M.png)

[Video: videos/2_1_01-008-M.mp4](videos/2_1_01-008-M.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. Because the driver of the truck may fail to see me
- B. Because I should show due consideration to the truck
- C. Because the alternate merging procedure applies here

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because the driver of the truck may fail to see me
- B. Because I should show due consideration to the truck

**Explanation:**
If you are in the dead corner of the truck and the truck suddenly exhaust yourself, a dangerous situation can occur and you would have to slow down. Since there is enough space between the vehicle in front, you should take the truck into account and enable it to change lanes.

#### Question 2.1.01-009

**Points:** 3 Points

**As a motorcyclist , why is it important that you adopt an anticipatory driving style especially on very winding stretches of road?**

**Options:**
- A. Because the turning radius can reduce as the road continues
- B. Because otherwise I will not be able to see dirt on the roadway in time
- C. Because it means I am able to adjust myself in good time to the actions of oncoming traffic

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because the turning radius can reduce as the road continues
- B. Because otherwise I will not be able to see dirt on the roadway in time
- C. Because it means I am able to adjust myself in good time to the actions of oncoming traffic

**Explanation:**
By riding with foresight, you can recognise the behaviour of oncoming traffic and potentially dangerous situations, such as dirt on the road or a change in cornering radius, in good time and adapt your riding behaviour accordingly.

#### Question 2.1.01-010

**Points:** 4 Points

**As a motorcyclist, you can easily go unnoticed by other vehicle drivers. How can you reduce this risk?**

**Options:**
- A. I avoid remaining for too long in the blind spot to the side of other vehicles
- B. I try to see the road situation from the perspective of other vehicle drivers
- C. Before taking a turn, I try to establish eye-contact with other drivers in my vicinity

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I avoid remaining for too long in the blind spot to the side of other vehicles
- B. I try to see the road situation from the perspective of other vehicle drivers
- C. Before taking a turn, I try to establish eye-contact with other drivers in my vicinity

**Explanation:**
Try to put yourself in the shoes of the drivers involved so that you can better understand what they might do next. This way, you may be able to recognise a potential hazard and react to it in good time.
If you are driving in a vehicle's side blind spot, the driver will not be able to see you. If possible, drive in such a way that you are not in the blind spot for an unnecessarily long time. You should also try to make eye contact with the drivers involved before turning to ensure that they can see you.

#### Question 2.1.01-101

**Points:** 4 Points

**What can cause a dangerous situation?**

**Options:**
- A. Brakes which engage heavily on one side
- B. Too much steering-wheel play
- C. Disturbed reception of traffic information on the radio

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Brakes which engage heavily on one side
- B. Too much steering-wheel play

**Explanation:**
If a foot brake has a strong one-sided effect, the vehicle may swing off laterally during braking. The car may skid and overturn. Therefore, unequal braking forces are extremely dangerous. Excessive steering can also lead to skidding at high speeds because you can no longer keep the lane properly. A disturbed traffic radio is not a technically dangerous defect.

#### Question 2.1.01-102

**Points:** 4 Points

**What are the effects of listening to loud music - especially with an extremely loud bass volume - in the car?**

**Options:**
- A. Blind people lose their orientation when they are near the car
- B. The driver’s attention is significantly impaired
- C. It makes it easier for blind people to recognise where the road is

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Blind people lose their orientation when they are near the car
- B. The driver’s attention is significantly impaired

**Explanation:**
Loud music in the car leads to two negative effects: The driver is distracted by the music and he cannot concentrate on the road. Deep basses in particular lead to strong uncertainty in blind road users. These can lose their orientation, especially with low-frequency music.

---

#### Question 2.1.01-103

**Points:** 4 Points

**What can create a hazard when driving?**

**Options:**
- A. A service brake that responds heavily on one side
- B. An excessive amount of play in the steering
- C. A faulty dipped headlight

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. A service brake that responds heavily on one side
- B. An excessive amount of play in the steering
- C. A faulty dipped headlight

**Explanation:**
If the dipped headlights are not working, you will see poorly on the one hand and you will be seen worse on the other. If the service brake is too one-sided, the vehicle could swerve or have a longer braking distance. If there is too much play in the steering, the steering command will not be carried out.

### 2.1.02 Chapter Behaviour Towards Pedestrians


#### Question 2.1.02-002

**Points:** 4 Points

**You are driving on a narrow road. About 20 m ahead of you a child suddenly runs onto the roadway. When is a collision unavoidable despite emergency braking?**

**Options:**
- A. 50 km/h
- B. 30 km/h
- C. 20 km/h

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. 50 km/h

**Explanation:**
For this question, you must first calculate the thinking distance and the hazard braking distance. At 50 km/h, the thinking distance is 50/10 x 3 = 15. So, there are 15 meters of thinking distance. The hazard braking distance is determined by the following calculation: [(50/10 x 50/10) / 2] = 12.5. 50 km/h is the right answer.

### 2.1.03 Chapter Road And Weather Conditions


#### Question 2.1.03-001

**Points:** 4 Points

**What must you reckon with when you are driving in the left-hand lane of an autobahn at high speed?**

**Options:**
- A. Motorists in front of you may suddenly pull out to overtake
- B. Even a slight, unexpected side wind can effect road stability
- C. If you have full beam switched on, vehicles travelling in front of you will not pull out to overtake

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Motorists in front of you may suddenly pull out to overtake
- B. Even a slight, unexpected side wind can effect road stability

**Explanation:**
At high speed, motorcycles are very sensitive to wind from the side. Small fast motorcycles are hard to see, other vehicles might therefore not see you.

- C. When the braking effect is different on both sides of the front disc brake

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. When you overtake a truck
- B. When driving under a bridge at high speed in a strong side wind

**Explanation:**
Sudden side wind increases the risk of a motorcycle to veer sideways. Sudden side wind can occur when exiting under a bridge, out of a tunnel, or when overtaking a truck.

#### Question 2.1.03-003

**Points:** 4 Points

**What must you reckon with when it starts raining after a longer period of dry weather?**

**Options:**
- A. A dangerous greasy film on the surface of the road
- B. Bad visibility through helmet visor or goggles
- C. Shorter braking distance

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. A dangerous greasy film on the surface of the road
- B. Bad visibility through helmet visor or goggles

**Explanation:**
Rain clean up part of the dirt on the road. If the weather was dry for a long period of time, the road will accumulate a lot of dirt. With the addition of water, it will create a film on the road that will make the surface more slippery and increase the braking distance. You can also expect poor visibility on your helmet or goggles.

#### Question 2.1.03-005

**Points:** 4 Points

**What can happen if you drive around a left-hand bend near the marked central line?**

**Options:**
- A. Because of the inclined position, the upper part of your body could be hit by oncoming traffic
- B. The motorcycle could catch the central line and slip from under you
- C. There is no danger as long as the tyres are new

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because of the inclined position, the upper part of your body could be hit by oncoming traffic
- B. The motorcycle could catch the central line and slip from under you

**Explanation:**
When turning left, being near the central line is dangerous. Due to the inclination left, you could be hit by a vehicle going in the opposite direction. Road markings such as the central line are slippery, if your motorcycle run on it, it could slip resulting in a fall

#### Question 2.1.03-015

**Points:** 5 Points

**What can cause in aquaplaning (sliding on wet roads) on wet road surfaces?**

**Options:**
- A. High speed
- B. Worn tyres
- C. Grooves in the roadway

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. High speed
- B. Worn tyres
- C. Grooves in the roadway

**Explanation:**
Aquaplaning - also known as hydroplaning - occurs when the tread depth of the tires is too low to displace the accumulated amount of water or when the amount of water to be discharged is too large due to a high speed (from 60 km/h). In addition, wheel ruts in the road, in which water accumulates, favor this effect.

#### Question 2.1.03-017-B

**Points:** 4 Points

**Why could overtaking be dangerous here?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_03-017-B.png)

**Options:**
- A. There is still slush on the overtaking lane
- B. Slush could be thrown up and impair visibility
- C. Because beneath the slush there could also be ice on the road

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. There is still slush on the overtaking lane
- B. Slush could be thrown up and impair visibility
- C. Because beneath the slush there could also be ice on the road

**Explanation:**
Overtaking in slush can lead to many dangers. Under the snow there could be a layer of ice that makes overtaking dangerous. In addition, you could hurl snow masses at other vehicles or to start swerving back and forth yourself.

#### Question 2.1.03-018

**Points:** 4 Points

**What must you do if your vehicle is caught by a strong side wind?**

**Options:**
- A. Steer against the wind
- B. Reduce speed
- C. Accelerate rapidly

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Steer against the wind
- B. Reduce speed

**Explanation:**
If your vehicle is hit by strong crosswinds, you should not accelerate, slow down instead and countersteer. The faster you drive, the less secure you can keep your vehicle on the road, since crosswinds can lead to skidding of the vehicle.

---

#### Question 2.1.03-020

**Points:** 4 Points

**When can strong side wind be particularly dangerous?**

**Options:**
- A. When overtaking trucks
- B. When driving across bridges
- C. When driving past firebreaks in forests

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. When overtaking trucks
- B. When driving across bridges
- C. When driving past firebreaks in forests

**Explanation:**
Changing wind directions are dangerous when driving. Sudden gusts can catch your vehicle and push it aside. You have to countersteer strongly to keep your vehicle in the lane. If the wind changes direction, you have to react quickly and adjust your steering behavior. Strong crosswind is a danger especially on bridges and on level, undeveloped and unwooded terrain. If you overtake one or more trucks, you will have to expect changing pressure conditions when entering the slipstream of the truck and when leaving the truck. At forest aisles or when leaving wooded areas, a strong crosswind can also hit you abruptly.

#### Question 2.1.03-021-B

**Points:** 4 Points

**What must you reckon with here?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_03-021-B.png)

**Options:**
- A. Your vehicle could be blown to the left by the strong side wind
- B. When overtaking, your vehicle is pulling to the right when you enter the slipstream of the truck
- C. The vehicle travelling in front of you can be blown to the right

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Your vehicle could be blown to the left by the strong side wind
- B. When overtaking, your vehicle is pulling to the right when you enter the slipstream of the truck

**Explanation:**
If you drive on the motorway in a strong crosswind from the right, the crosswind constantly pushes the car to the left. You have to countersteer to the right to stay in the lane. If you overtake a truck, expect that the pressure from the crosswind is gone immediately as you enter the slipstream of the truck. If you continue to countersteer, there is a risk that you drive against the truck. Since the crosswind comes from the right, the front vehicle could be pushed to the left.

---

#### Question 2.1.03-022-B

**Points:** 4 Points

**A strong side wind is blowing from the right. When are you particularly exposed to danger when overtaking?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_03-022-B.png)

**Options:**
- A. When you enter the slipstream of the truck
- B. When you leave the slipstream of the truck
- C. When you change lane after overtaking

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. When you enter the slipstream of the truck
- B. When you leave the slipstream of the truck

**Explanation:**
If there is strong crosswind from the right, you are particularly at risk as a car driver if you enter the slipstream of a truck as part of an overtaking maneuver. This danger arises from the fact that strong side wind from the right pushes your vehicle to the left, whereupon you automatically start countersteering. As you overtake a truck, you fall into its slipstream; the crosswind is instantly gone and you have to adjust the steering. As soon as you get out of the slipstream, the pressure starts again with the crosswind; So, you have to countersteer again.

---

#### Question 2.1.03-023

**Points:** 5 Points

**Why must you reduce your speed in heavy rain?**

**Options:**
- A. Because braking distance is increased
- B. Because visibility is reduced
- C. Because aquaplaning (sliding on wet roads) can occur

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because braking distance is increased
- B. Because visibility is reduced
- C. Because aquaplaning (sliding on wet roads) can occur

**Explanation:**
Water on the windshield or visor breaks the light and worsens the view, whirling up water also obstructs the view. The braking distance is longer on wet roads because of lower grip. The profile of the tires drains the water. At high speed, the amount of water to be drained is too large, there is a risk of aquaplaning. In this case, there is no contact between the road and the tire. The vehicle cannot be controlled any longer.

#### Question 2.1.03-024-B

**Points:** 4 Points

**What adversely affects road safety here?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_03-024-B.png)

**Options:**
- A. Poor visibility
- B. Reduced grip of the tyres on the wet roadway
- C. The dipped headlights of oncoming traffic

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Poor visibility
- B. Reduced grip of the tyres on the wet roadway

**Explanation:**
The rain and the whirled-up water create a haze that can significantly affect traffic safety. Assume that the grip of the tires is significantly lower due to the wet road surface than on dry roads and that this prolongs your braking distance. The low beam of oncoming traffic does not affect the traffic safety, as the car driver is not dazzled by it.

---

#### Question 2.1.03-025

**Points:** 3 Points

**What can be caused if the road surface suddenly becomes worse?**

**Options:**
- A. Danger of sliding and skidding
- B. Changes in tyre noise
- C. Longer reaction distance

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Danger of sliding and skidding
- B. Changes in tyre noise

**Explanation:**
As the road surface deteriorates, it always results in a change and deterioration of traction. As the wheels lose stiction, the vehicle is slipping and skidding faster. The tire noise also depends on the condition of the road surface and changes when, for example, the road turns from a paved road to a cobblestone track.

#### Question 2.1.03-027

**Points:** 4 Points

**What are the special conditions when driving along tree-lined avenues?**

**Options:**
- A. Bends are often very narrow and blind
- B. The narrow and often cambered roadway requires special caution when there is oncoming traffic
- C. The trees provide protection from the sides

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Bends are often very narrow and blind
- B. The narrow and often cambered roadway requires special caution when there is oncoming traffic

**Explanation:**
The road is usually very narrow. In addition, it is often heavily curved to drain rainwater. Therefore, special care should be taken with oncoming traffic. Curves are not clear due to the trees. You have to drive particularly careful because of the possible oncoming traffic in curves. Left turns are especially dangerous. The trees don't offer any protection to the driver, not even windbreak.

**Options:**
- A. - green car
- B. - blue car
- C. - tractor

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - green car

**Explanation:**
Snow is a special danger for you as a car driver. Your lane is covered in snow. In addition, your view is restricted by a heap of snow. The upcoming green car does not respect the right of way. Therefore, you should brake early, because due to the slipperiness of the braking distance is extended. Probably the green car is also hampered by the snow pile.

- A. Reduced ability to steer the vehicle
- B. Reduced vehicle braking capability
- C. Increased tyre static friction

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Reduced ability to steer the vehicle
- B. Reduced vehicle braking capability

**Explanation:**
In the event of aquaplaning, your vehicle has no direct contact with the road surface, so the steering command and the braking command cannot be implemented.

#### Question 2.1.03-036

**Points:** 3 Points

**What is the correct course of action in this situation?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_03-036.png)

**Options:**
- A. I reduce my speed
- B. I avoid abrupt steering movements
- C. I brake hard

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I reduce my speed
- B. I avoid abrupt steering movements

**Explanation:**
The traffic sign indicates a risk of skidding and sliding. To avoid skidding, you should reduce your speed, especially when it is raining and leaves are falling on the road, as is the case here. Braking hard, accelerating hard or steering jerkily can cause the tyres to lose their grip and you could skid or slide.

#### Question 2.1.03-037

**Points:** 4 Points

**What should you be prepared for here?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_03-037.png)

**Options:**
- A. For an extended braking distance
- B. For the poor visibility of my vehicle
- C. For increased tyre traction

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. For an extended braking distance
- B. For the poor visibility of my vehicle

**Explanation:**
Because of the rain, you should be prepared for the fact that other vehicles will not be able to see your vehicle and that your braking distance will be longer due to the reduced grip.

#### Question 2.1.03-038

**Points:** 4 Points

**Where are you particularly at risk during an overtaking manoeuvre here?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_03-038.png)

**Options:**
- A. When driving into the truck’s wind-sheltered area
- B. When driving out of the truck’s wind-sheltered area
- C. When changing lane after overtaking

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. When driving into the truck’s wind-sheltered area
- B. When driving out of the truck’s wind-sheltered area

**Explanation:**
If there is a strong side wind from the right, you as a motorist are particularly at risk if, when driving off-road, you overtake in the slipstream of a truck. This hazard arises from the fact that strong cross winds from the right push your vehicle to the left, whereupon you automatically countersteer. As you overtake a truck, you slipstream into it; the crosswind is gone instantly and you have to adjust the steering. As soon as you pull out of the slipstream, the pressure starts up again with the crosswind; You have to countersteer again.

#### Question 2.1.03-039-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**What could happen if you pass through a bend close to the lane markings?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_03-039-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. - be struck by oncoming traffic
- B. - lose control of my motorbike while attempting to avoid oncoming traffic
- C. - be able to see well around the bend

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - be struck by oncoming traffic
- B. - lose control of my motorbike while attempting to avoid oncoming traffic

**Explanation:**
Always make sure that you and your motorbike are not overhanging the centre line. If you take blind bends, you are unnecessarily endangering yourself and oncoming traffic. This is because you could be hit by oncoming traffic or lose control of your motorbike during evasive manoeuvres.

#### Question 2.1.03-040

**Points:** 3 Points

**What can increase the risk of a motorcycle fall while driving through road bends?**

**Options:**
- A. An oil spill on the carriageway
- B. A bump on the carriageway
- C. A carriageway inclines towards the inside of the bend

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. An oil spill on the carriageway
- B. A bump on the carriageway

**Explanation:**
Oil on the road increases the risk of falling when cornering, as the tyres' grip is significantly reduced due to the slippery surface.
Unevenness in the road surface, such as bumps, reduces the grip of the tyres and therefore increases the risk of falling.

---

#### Question 2.1.03-041

**Points:** 3 Points

**How can you reduce the risk of falling when encountering wet road markings?**

**Options:**
- A. I avoid driving on the road markings as much as possible
- B. I take the short distance possible when driving across the road markings
- C. I brake as sharply as possible before encountering the road markings

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I avoid driving on the road markings as much as possible
- B. I take the short distance possible when driving across the road markings

**Explanation:**
As the road markings are slippery, especially when wet, you should avoid driving over them if possible. If it is not possible to drive around them, you should take the shortest route across them to minimise the risk of falling.
Due to the wetness, you should avoid accelerating or braking here to minimise the risk of falling.

---

#### Question 2.1.03-042

**Points:** 3 Points

**What should you anticipate when driving on wet cobblestones?**

**Options:**
- A. A high tendency for the wheels to lock during braking
- B. A rapid skidding of the rear wheel when accelerating
- C. An increased traction of the front wheel during steering

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. A high tendency for the wheels to lock during braking
- B. A rapid skidding of the rear wheel when accelerating

**Explanation:**
An uneven and wet road surface and therefore less grip increases the risk of the rear wheel spinning or slipping when accelerating.
When braking on wet cobblestones, the tendency to lock up is increased, which can cause the rear wheel to slip sideways more quickly.
Locking tendency means that the front wheel is loaded more and the rear wheel is unloaded when braking.

---

#### Question 2.1.03-043

**Points:** 3 Points

**What should you take into account when you drive a motorcycle during low ambient temperatures?**

**Options:**
- A. The helmet visor is prone to misting up
- B. The handbrake lever cannot be safely operated with cold fingers
- C. Freezing improves the ability to concentrate

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. The helmet visor is prone to misting up
- B. The handbrake lever cannot be safely operated with cold fingers

**Explanation:**
If the temperature of the outside air differs from the air temperature in the helmet, the helmet will mist up. This greatly impairs visibility. 
In addition, the handbrake lever is more difficult to operate with cold fingers.

#### Question 2.1.03-044-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**What must you anticipate in this situation?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_03-044-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. My vehicle may be forced leftwards
- B. When driving into the wind-protected area alongside the truck, my vehicle may be forced rightwards
- C. The truck ahead of me may be forced rightwards

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. My vehicle may be forced leftwards
- B. When driving into the wind-protected area alongside the truck, my vehicle may be forced rightwards

**Explanation:**
You can see from the windsock that a strong wind is blowing from the right. The strong wind could move your vehicle to the left. Be prepared to steer to the right.
In addition, when entering the slipstream of the truck, you must be prepared for your vehicle to be moved to the right because its large surface area will keep out the crosswind. Be prepared to steer to the left to avoid colliding with the truck.

#### Question 2.1.03-045-M

**Points:** 3 Points

**Heavy rain has caused large puddles to form on the road surface. What is the right course of action now?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_03-045-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. - slowly to avoid create road spray
- B. - quickly to maintain the stability of my motorbike
- C. - with my feet elevated to prevent getting wet

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - slowly to avoid create road spray

**Explanation:**
You can easily lose control of your motorbike when riding through large puddles. Ride slowly and do not lift your feet to keep your motorbike stable and avoid splashing water.

---

#### Question 2.1.03-046

**Points:** 3 Points

**What should you anticipate while driving, when it starts to rain after a long dry period?**

**Options:**
- A. A particularly slippery road surface
- B. Poor visibility through my helmet visor
- C. A shorter braking distance

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. A particularly slippery road surface
- B. Poor visibility through my helmet visor

**Explanation:**
Basically, you must always expect visibility through your helmet visor to be poorer in the rain and, if it is dry for a long time, a layer of dirt will remain on the road which can form a slippery film on the road surface when it rains, so you must expect the road to be particularly slippery.

#### Question 2.1.03-101

**Points:** 5 Points

**Where does aquaplaning (sliding on wet roads) occur particularly often?**

**Options:**
- A. In dips in the roadway
- B. Where there are grooves in the roadway
- C. At level crossings

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. In dips in the roadway
- B. Where there are grooves in the roadway

**Explanation:**
If the speed is too high and/or there is more water than can be drained from the tire profiles, aquaplaning occurs. A water film prevents contact between tires and the road. The vehicle is no longer controllable. The risk of aquaplaning exists in particular in ruts and road subsidence. Level crossings usually have no increased risk for aquaplaning, since water can usually run well here.

---

#### Question 2.1.03-102

**Points:** 5 Points

**What does aquaplaning (sliding on wet roads) lead to?**

**Options:**
- A. The vehicle can no longer be steered and braked
- B. The vehicle can leave the road
- C. Steering becomes heavy

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. The vehicle can no longer be steered and braked
- B. The vehicle can leave the road

**Explanation:**
Aquaplaning or hydroplaning can lead to neither being able to brake or steer. As a result, conscious driving of the vehicle is no longer possible. It can get into a skid. This effect is caused by a kind of water gore, which slides between the tire and the road.

#### Question 2.1.03-103

**Points:** 4 Points

**What must you reckon with when it starts raining after a long period of dry weather?**

**Options:**
- A. A dangerous greasy film on the surface of the road
- B. Bad visibility immediately upon switching the windscreen wipers on
- C. Shorter braking distance

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. A dangerous greasy film on the surface of the road
- B. Bad visibility immediately upon switching the windscreen wipers on

**Explanation:**
If rain sets in after prolonged drought, a dangerous film of lubricant forms on the road, which is only washed away after a long period of rain. This film is more dangerous than rain alone. Brake very carefully. This lubricating film is also deposited on the windscreen. After turning on the windscreen wipers, it first worsens the view drastically. The braking distance is extended by the poorer traction.

---

#### Question 2.1.03-104

**Points:** 4 Points

**It starts raining. Why must you immediately increase the safe distance?**

**Options:**
- A. Because a greasy film may form which increases the braking distance
- B. Because visibility may become worse and the windscreen wipers do not immediately provide a clear field of vision
- C. Because the brakes react more quickly

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because a greasy film may form which increases the braking distance
- B. Because visibility may become worse and the windscreen wipers do not immediately provide a clear field of vision

**Explanation:**
When it starts raining, you must immediately increase the safety distance for the following reasons: Under the influence of moisture, the dirt, dust and fine deposits from tire abrasion or pollen on the road turn into a dangerous film of grease. This reduces the traction and thereby extends the braking distance. This lubricating film also forms on the windscreen and on the brake drums. If you use the windscreen wipers, they will first worsen your view and smudge the window. On the brake drums, this lubricating film leads to a slower response of the brakes in wet conditions.

#### Question 2.1.03-105

**Points:** 4 Points

**You are driving in dense fog on a federal road (Bundesstraße) outside a built-up area. Are you allowed to drive in the middle of the road continuously straddling the broken white line?**

**Options:**
- A. No, because it could represent a danger to oncoming traffic
- B. Yes, if fog headlamps and rear fog lamps are switched on
- C. Yes, because it reduces the risk of running off the road

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. No, because it could represent a danger to oncoming traffic

**Explanation:**
Driving on the center line is not allowed even in dense fog, especially as drivers can always collide with oncoming traffic due to reduced visibility. If there's fog, slow down and orient yourself on the right side of the road for a safe ride.

---

#### Question 2.1.03-106

**Points:** 4 Points

**What must you do on encountering sudden dense fog driving at daytime?**

**Options:**
- A. Adapt speed immediately to visibility conditions
- B. Switch on dipped headlights
- C. Only switch on parking lights

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Adapt speed immediately to visibility conditions
- B. Switch on dipped headlights

**Explanation:**
As a car driver you must turn on low beam during the day when there's fog, snowfall and other poor visibility. Because of the insufficient luminosity driving with parking light is not permitted. Adjust your speed to the visibility conditions and use the rear fog light when you can see less than 50 meters.

---

#### Question 2.1.03-107

**Points:** 3 Points

**How can you achieve sufficient visibility through the windscreen?**

**Options:**
- A. Switch on the windscreen wipers from time to time when it is foggy
- B. When there is slush, switch on the windscreen wipers already before slush is thrown onto your windscreen by other vehicles
- C. When the windscreen is steamed up, switch the ventilator off and keep the windows closed

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Switch on the windscreen wipers from time to time when it is foggy
- B. When there is slush, switch on the windscreen wipers already before slush is thrown onto your windscreen by other vehicles

**Explanation:**
Turn your windscreen wipers to interval switching, during fog in order to remove fine water droplets from the mist. Turn on your windscreen wipers before overtaking or being overtaken so that obstructions caused by slush or spray water are immediately removed. Avoid fogged windows with the correct ventilation setting: Set ventilation to outside air supply and not to circulating air. Open the windows a gap to let the moisture escape. Briefly switching on the air conditioning dehumidifies the air very quickly.

#### Question 2.1.03-109

**Points:** 4 Points

**You want to overtake on a narrow avenue not within a built-up area. What must you be aware of in particular?**

**Options:**
- A. Even cyclists frequently cannot be overtaken when there is oncoming traffic due to the narrow width of the roadway
- B. Misjudgements of distances and oncoming traffic frequently result in serious accidents
- C. Vehicles with high superstructures frequently move to avoid branches

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Even cyclists frequently cannot be overtaken when there is oncoming traffic due to the narrow width of the roadway
- B. Misjudgements of distances and oncoming traffic frequently result in serious accidents
- C. Vehicles with high superstructures frequently move to avoid branches

**Explanation:**
Due to the narrow width of the lanes, even cyclists cannot be overtaken with oncoming traffic. Often, the road is heavily curved to drain rainwater, that means when crossing the center line, the vehicle tilts to the other side. This load change reduces the driving stability. Due to the trees, curves can be confusing. Vehicles with tall bodies often need to travel in the center to avoid colliding with branches and could reach into your lane.

#### Question 2.1.03-110

**Points:** 4 Points

**What do you have to be aware of in this situation?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_03-110.png)

**Options:**
- A. The speed should be adjusted due to the visibility
- B. Judging distances is made more difficult because of the constant changing of light and shadows
- C. The constant changing of light and shadows makes it more difficult to detect other road users in good time

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. The speed should be adjusted due to the visibility
- B. Judging distances is made more difficult because of the constant changing of light and shadows
- C. The constant changing of light and shadows makes it more difficult to detect other road users in good time

**Explanation:**
A sudden and strong change of lighting conditions, you must reduce your speed, because the human eye otherwise cannot react fast enough to the change of light. Other road users or obstacles are very difficult to perceive in dark areas.

#### Question 2.1.03-111

**Points:** 4 Points

**When overtaking several trucks, you are faced with this situation. What should you do now?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_03-111.png)

**Options:**
- A. I abort the overtaking manoeuvre
- B. After pulling back into lane, I again establish an adequate safety distance
- C. I continue overtaking quickly and pull back into lane in front of the red truck

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I abort the overtaking manoeuvre
- B. After pulling back into lane, I again establish an adequate safety distance

**Explanation:**
The visibility is very poor due to the weather and the road is not sufficiently visible. In order not to endanger anyone, you should stop the overtaking process as quickly as possible and ensure that you are at a safe distance from the vehicle in front of you when you go back into lane.

#### Question 2.1.03-113

**Points:** 4 Points

**When is there an increased risk of falling during steering and braking manoeuvres?**

**Options:**
- A. On wet cobblestone pavement
- B. On wet asphalt
- C. On carriageways with loose chippings

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. On wet cobblestone pavement
- B. On wet asphalt
- C. On carriageways with loose chippings

**Explanation:**
When turning on bends or braking, slippery surfaces such as lane markings, oil on the road, dirt, manholes, sand, dust, gravel, wet surfaces, cobblestones or leaves will increase the risk of falling

---

#### Question 2.1.03-114

**Points:** 4 Points

**Wet road markings increase the risk of a fall. How can you reduce this danger of falling?**

**Options:**
- A. Cross road markings at the interstice points
- B. Do not accelerate or brake on markings
- C. Cross long markings at a sharp angle

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Cross road markings at the interstice points
- B. Do not accelerate or brake on markings

**Explanation:**
Wet markings similarly to tram tracks are slippery. You should cross them as perpendicularly as possible and try to no accelerate or brake on them.

**Points:** 4 Points

**What is the right course of action?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_03-115.png)

[Video: videos/2_1_03-115.mp4](videos/2_1_03-115.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. I continue slowing down
- B. I wait before the obstruction
- C. I switch to the left lane now

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I continue slowing down
- B. I wait before the obstruction

**Explanation:**
There are two lanes in your direction of travel. You drive on the right side of the two tracks. In oncoming traffic, a snow plow truck approaches. You see in the mirror that a vehicle in the left lane next to you wants to overtake. Snowdrifts hinder you while driving on the lane. You cannot turn left unless the overtaking is completed. Therefore, you must delay further and wait in front of the obstacle until you can dodge to the left.

- B. - continue driving in my lane
- C. - drive to the left past the damaged road surface

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - greatly reduce my speed
- B. - continue driving in my lane

**Explanation:**
In the event of lane damage before a turn, you should reduce your speed considerably to avoid damaging the vehicle. Due to the confusion of the curve, you should not drive past the lane damage on the left, but continue on the right on your lane.

#### Question 2.1.03-118

**Points:** 3 Points

**The electronic stability programme (ESP) display has flashed several times. What is the correct course of action in this situation?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_03-118.png)

[Video: videos/2_1_03-118.mp4](videos/2_1_03-118.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. I reduce my speed, because it is too high
- B. I maintain my speed, because the ESP ensures I can continue driving safely
- C. I go to a garage, because the ESP display is indicating a fault

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I reduce my speed, because it is too high

**Explanation:**
The Electronic Stability Program (ESP) is always active. If the ESP light flashes, it shows you that it is actively intervening in the driving behaviour of the vehicle and stabilising it. Therefore, the speed should be reduced.
If the ESP symbol is permanently lit, it is inactive or defective and needs to be checked.

#### Question 2.1.03-119

**Points:** 3 Points

**While driving, you use your vehicle’s adaptive cruise control (ACC) system. What must you anticipate in these weather conditions?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_03-119.png)

**Options:**
- A. The functionality of the ACC may be negatively affected
- B. I have to personally control my speed and distance
- C. The ACC stops the vehicle

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. The functionality of the ACC may be negatively affected
- B. I have to personally control my speed and distance

**Explanation:**
The adaptive cruise control system (ASC) independently estimates the distance and speed of the vehicle in front.  This can be limited in bad weather, e.g. due to snow and dirt. Therefore, you must regulate the distance and speed yourself.

#### Question 2.1.03-120

**Points:** 4 Points

**You are driving along a narrow avenue. What must you be aware of?**

**Options:**
- A. - be able to stop within half of the distance visible to me
- B. - stop for oncoming traffic, if necessary
- C. - anticipate unevenness at the edge of the road caused by tree roots

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - be able to stop within half of the distance visible to me
- B. - stop for oncoming traffic, if necessary
- C. - anticipate unevenness at the edge of the road caused by tree roots

**Explanation:**
The narrow width of the road and its often curved shape due to tree roots force you to take extra care when cornering and when facing oncoming traffic. Choose your speed in such a way that the vehicle can be brought to a halt within half the visible distance. Example: With a visibility of approx. 40 metres, you should choose your speed so that you come to a stop within approx. 20 metres. In purely mathematical terms, the stopping distance at 30 km/h is 18 metres.

[Video: videos/2_1_03-121.mp4](videos/2_1_03-121.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. I reduce my speed, because it is too high
- B. I maintain my speed, because the ESC system ensures I can continue driving safely
- C. I go to a garage, because the ESC display is indicating a fault

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I reduce my speed, because it is too high

**Explanation:**
You have to reduce your speed. Due to the slippery road surface and the obviously too high speed in the curves for the road conditions, the wheels lose grip and the car could skid.

#### Question 2.1.03-122

**Points:** 4 Points

**What must you anticipate here?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_03-122.png)

**Options:**
- A. Pedestrians on the carriageway
- B. A reduced amount of side clearance from oncoming traffic
- C. That you may be dazzled by the low-lying sun

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Pedestrians on the carriageway
- B. A reduced amount of side clearance from oncoming traffic

**Explanation:**
The snow on the right and left sides of the road may limit the lane. Therefore, you must expect that the distance to oncoming traffic is reduced.
In addition, you can see from the traffic sign that there is a parking area for walkers on the right-hand side. Therefore, you must expect that there are pedestrians on the roadway.

#### Question 2.1.03-123

**Points:** 4 Points

**While driving straight ahead, you lose control of your vehicle due to aquaplaning. What is the proper response now?**

**Options:**
- A. I gently take my foot off the accelerator
- B. I keep the steering wheel as straight as possible
- C. I brake firmly

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I gently take my foot off the accelerator
- B. I keep the steering wheel as straight as possible

**Explanation:**
During aquaplaning, you cannot turn or change the direction of your car. You should also not accelerate or brake. So just carefully take your foot off the gas pedal and try to keep the wheel straight until your wheels touch the road again.

#### Question 2.1.03-124

**Points:** 4 Points

**Why is it dangerous to overtake on this snow-covered carriageway?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_03-124.png)

**Options:**
- A. Because my vehicle may skid
- B. Because parts of the carriageway may be iced over
- C. Because my vision may become even more negatively affected

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because my vehicle may skid
- B. Because parts of the carriageway may be iced over
- C. Because my vision may become even more negatively affected

**Explanation:**
In the event of sneaky, icy road, the tires have less liability and can slip. You should avoid sudden braking through slow, forward -looking driving so as not to skid.
In addition, the in front can also be thrown on the left lane due to the clearing/ stray vehicle in front and your view also deteriorates.

#### Question 2.1.04-002

**Points:** 3 Points

**What must you do if wild animals suddenly appear in the full beam of your headlights?**

**Options:**
- A. Immediately dip your headlights
- B. Sound the horn and brake
- C. Proceed on full beam

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Immediately dip your headlights
- B. Sound the horn and brake

**Explanation:**
Hold the steering wheel tightly and brake. Dip the high beam, because it dazzles the game and therefore remains on the road. Honk to scare it away. Avoid trying to dodge at high speed. These maneuvers often end at a tree or in oncoming traffic. That's why the following rules apply when there's game on the road: slow down, dip the lights and honk to scare off the game.

**Options:**
- A. Avoid looking at the headlights of the approaching vehicle and direct your gaze towards the right-hand edge of the roadway
- B. Also switch on full beam
- C. Lower the sun visor

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Avoid looking at the headlights of the approaching vehicle and direct your gaze towards the right-hand edge of the roadway

**Explanation:**
If you are dazzled by the light from an oncoming vehicle, look to the right side of the road if possible. This reduces the dazzling effect and you can still stay the lane. It's prohibited to dazzle back by switching on the high beam. Folding down the sun shade is not an appropriate action as it will impair your vision too much.

#### Question 2.1.04-102

**Points:** 4 Points

**You are driving on a country road in darkness and rain and encounter oncoming vehicles with dipped headlights. What must you remember?**

**Options:**
- A. You can be dazzled by reflections on the wet road
- B. Your wet windscreen can result in your being dazzled
- C. You can avoid possible dazzle by switching on full beam

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. You can be dazzled by reflections on the wet road
- B. Your wet windscreen can result in your being dazzled

**Explanation:**
You must not turn on the high beam in this situation, as this can strongly dazzle oncoming traffic. Especially on wet roads, the reflection of the light is greatly increased. Further interferences include drops of water and streaks on the windscreen, which scatter the light and cloud the view.

#### Question 2.1.04-103

**Points:** 4 Points

**What risks could arise if you drive with your main beam lights on?**

**Options:**
- A. Oncoming road users will be dazzled
- B. Wild animals on the road will be dazzled and will remain stationary in the light beam
- C. Stationary vehicles on my side of the road will not be detected until it is too late

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Oncoming road users will be dazzled
- B. Wild animals on the road will be dazzled and will remain stationary in the light beam

**Explanation:**
With high beam on, you can dazzle drivers in front of you and oncoming traffic, which may result in recognizing pedestrians and cyclists not at all or way too late. Game that is crossing the road can also be dazzled, which may lead to the animals remaining in the cone of light. With high beam you can recognize vehicles that broke down better.

#### Question 2.1.04-104

**Points:** 4 Points

**Driving at night-time on a rural road, you see persons on your side of the road. What do you do if you are dazzled by an oncoming vehicle?**

**Options:**
- A. - look towards the right-hand side of the road
- B. - stop if necessary
- C. - turn on my main beam lights

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - look towards the right-hand side of the road
- B. - stop if necessary

**Explanation:**
If you detect people on the side of the road at night as a car driver, you should slow down. Regular eye-contact with the roadside is ideal to avoid an accident. If you are also blinded, you can move to the right and stop.

#### Question 2.1.04-105

**Points:** 4 Points

**You are driving on an avenue, with a narrow carriageway. What must you be aware of?**

**Options:**
- A. I may only drive at a speed that allows me to stop within half of my range of vision
- B. Conflicts can arise with the oncoming traffic
- C. I have to anticipate unevenness at the edge of the carriageway caused by tree roots

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I may only drive at a speed that allows me to stop within half of my range of vision
- B. Conflicts can arise with the oncoming traffic
- C. I have to anticipate unevenness at the edge of the carriageway caused by tree roots

**Explanation:**
On narrow avenues you are only allowed to drive at a speed that allows you to stop within half the visibility if oncoming traffic approaches. There may be conflicts with oncoming traffic. You may have to slow down, brake and drive to the right or reverse until the road gets wider to allow oncoming traffic drive past you. The roadside of avenues can be particularly uneven because tree roots lift the pavement.

---

#### Question 2.1.04-106

**Points:** 3 Points

**What increases the risk of an accident?**

**Options:**
- A. - with the sun low in the sky out front
- B. - with a misted up windscreen
- C. - with iced over side windows

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - with the sun low in the sky out front
- B. - with a misted up windscreen
- C. - with iced over side windows

**Explanation:**
The risk of accidents is significantly increased if your windscreen and side windows are steamed up or iced over, as you can only see the traffic to a limited extent. Clear all windows before you set off.
You could also be dazzled if you drive towards the low sun. This could make you notice other road users later and increase the risk of an accident. Be extra focussed, wear sunglasses or roll down your sun visor.

### 2.1.05 Chapter Speed


#### Question 2.1.05-001

**Points:** 4 Points

**You have been driving at high speed for some time. What effects can this have?**

**Options:**
- A. You lose your feel for speed
- B. Your powers of concentration diminish
- C. The feel for the right speed on bends grows

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. You lose your feel for speed
- B. Your powers of concentration diminish

**Explanation:**
You quickly get used to high speeds and you kind of enter a state of a rush. Especially at motorway exits, this can have a fatal impact, as your ability to concentrate and your reaction speed quickly decreases. So, look at the speedometer again and again!

---

#### Question 2.1.05-002

**Points:** 4 Points

**What can result from driving for a long time at high speed?**

**Options:**
- A. You lose your feel for speed
- B. You drive too close to vehicles in front
- C. Your reactions improve

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. You lose your feel for speed
- B. You drive too close to vehicles in front

**Explanation:**
The senses have become accustomed to the fast pace and you start to underestimate certain situations. Therefore, drivers often drive at high speed into sharp turns on the freeway exit ramps. The fast and monotonous driving decreases the ability to concentrate and thus the readiness to react. Often the safety distance is neglected and drivers drive too close to the car in front.

---

#### Question 2.1.05-004

**Points:** 4 Points

**When is there a danger of underestimating your own speed?**

**Options:**
- A. When the road is wide and there are no trees, buildings, fences etc. at the edge of the road
- B. When you have already been driving at high speed for some time
- C. When the roadside features (trees, houses, fences) are constantly changing

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. When the road is wide and there are no trees, buildings, fences etc. at the edge of the road
- B. When you have already been driving at high speed for some time

**Explanation:**
The danger of underestimating one's own driving speed comes into place when you made a long journey driving at high speed, for example on the highway. Even wide, clear roads quickly beguile you to drive at high speed. On the other hand, a changing roadside development has the opposite effect.

---

#### Question 2.1.05-005

**Points:** 4 Points

**What can lead to your dangerously underestimating your own speed?**

**Options:**
- A. Driving for a long time at high speed
- B. Driving on a good, wide road
- C. Loud engine and tyre noise

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Driving for a long time at high speed
- B. Driving on a good, wide road

**Explanation:**
Wide and clear roads without changing roadside development can lead to dangerous underestimation of one's own speed. But also, longer trips at higher speeds, such as on the highway, can lead to this effect. On the other hand, strong engine and tire noise let the driver perceive the speed more consciously.

---

#### Question 2.1.05-006

**Points:** 4 Points

**You are approaching a narrow left-hand bend at high speed. Why must you reduce speed already before entering the bend?**

**Options:**
- A. - otherwise you will be thrown out of the bend to the right
- B. - you will go into a skid if you do not brake until you are on the bend
- C. - otherwise you will be thrown out of the bend to the left

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - otherwise you will be thrown out of the bend to the right
- B. - you will go into a skid if you do not brake until you are on the bend

**Explanation:**
For you as the car driver there is a risk of skidding at increased speed. In the worst case, you could be thrown out of the bend and lose control of the vehicle. The centrifugal forces are too high at an increased speed. The tires can then no longer transfer the braking forces. That's why you should break early enough.

---

#### Question 2.1.05-007-B

**Points:** 4 Points

**What must you do?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_05-007-B.png)

**Options:**
- A. Drive slowly because children might run out from between the parked vehicles at any time
- B. Drive slowly because a door on one of the vehicles could be opened on the roadway side
- C. Drive at the permitted maximum speed because there is no actual apparent danger

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Drive slowly because children might run out from between the parked vehicles at any time
- B. Drive slowly because a door on one of the vehicles could be opened on the roadway side

**Explanation:**
In this situation, you should stay below the speed limit. Children or other pedestrians could run onto the roadway between parked vehicles. In addition, you should expect that the doors of the parked vehicles could suddenly be opened to the side of the road.

---

#### Question 2.1.05-008

**Points:** 4 Points

**You are approaching a sharp left-hand bend at high speed. Why is it necessary to reduce your speed before you have actually reached the bend?**

**Options:**
- A. - could slide off to the right along the bend
- B. - could begin to skid
- C. - could slide off to the left along the bend

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - could slide off to the right along the bend
- B. - could begin to skid

**Explanation:**
Due to your high speed, the centrifugal force may cause your vehicle to skid out of the bend on the right. Therefore, you should reduce your speed before the bend.

---

#### Question 2.1.05-009

**Points:** 4 Points

**In what situation does a driver frequently underestimate their own speed?**

**Options:**
- A. On wide, well-finished roads
- B. After a long journey at high speed
- C. On narrow roads with uneven road surfaces

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. On wide, well-finished roads
- B. After a long journey at high speed

**Explanation:**
When driving constantly at high speed, the ability to concentrate decreases. You get used to the speed. Also, wide roads with little peripheral development make you less aware of how fast you are actually going. The reaction time is prolonged.

---

#### Question 2.1.05-010

**Points:** 3 Points

**What should you anticipate when driving at high speed on the motorway?**

**Options:**
- A. Other road users underestimating my speed
- B. Cross winds can negatively affect my stability on the road
- C. I might not respond to hazards in good enough time

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Other road users underestimating my speed
- B. Cross winds can negatively affect my stability on the road
- C. I might not respond to hazards in good enough time

**Explanation:**
Other road users may underestimate your speed and suddenly pull out to overtake, for example. You may not be able to brake in time at high speed if a dangerous situation arises. If you see that danger is imminent, reduce your speed accordingly beforehand. 
In addition, at high speeds, even a slight crosswind can cause your vehicle to veer to the right or left.

---

#### Question 2.1.05-101

**Points:** 4 Points

**What is especially important when choosing the speed for driving along tree-lined avenues with narrow roadways?**

**Options:**
- A. To estimate the lateral distance to the trees and oncoming traffic simultaneously
- B. It may be necessary to stop within half the visible distance when a wide vehicle is coming from the opposite direction
- C. Rapidly changing light conditions make it easier to estimate lateral distances

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. To estimate the lateral distance to the trees and oncoming traffic simultaneously
- B. It may be necessary to stop within half the visible distance when a wide vehicle is coming from the opposite direction

**Explanation:**
When driving on an avenue with narrow lane width, you must consider the following factors when choosing your speed: Due to the rows of trees on the side, the lighting conditions can change quickly. This makes it difficult for you to estimate the distances to the sides and oncoming traffic. You have to choose your speed so that you can stop halfway on the track, which you can overlook. This is particularly important because wide or tall vehicles often drive in the middle of avenues due to space requirements.

#### Question 2.1.05-102

**Points:** 4 Points

**Why are you required to slow down now?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_05-102.png)

[Video: videos/2_1_05-102.mp4](videos/2_1_05-102.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. Because of the animal
- B. Because of the tractor
- C. Because of the course of the road

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because of the animal

**Explanation:**
An animal runs on the road from the right. Since there is no vehicle behind you, you should delay, brake and drive to the right. This is the safest way to handle possible scenarios: the tractor could hit the animal and start skidding, the tractor could drive on your lane in an evasive maneuver, you could hit the animal and lose control of your vehicle.

---

#### Question 2.1.05-103

**Points:** 4 Points

**Where must you anticipate dangerous situations suddenly arising?**

**Options:**
- A. In forested areas
- B. After hilltops
- C. In front of schools

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. In forested areas
- B. After hilltops
- C. In front of schools

**Explanation:**
You must be aware of sudden, dangerous situations when: 1. visibility is severely restricted; 2. Persons or animals could unexpectedly appear on the road. In the case of limited visibility, you may detect obstacles such as broken vehicles on the roadway too late. You have less time to react accordingly. In forest areas you have to expect wild animals crossing suddenly during dusk times; in residential areas you have to expect children playing on the street. Caution is also required in front of schools and at school bus stops.

#### Question 2.1.05-104-M

**Points:** 5 Points

**Why do you have to lower your speed here?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_05-104-M.png)

[Video: videos/2_1_05-104-M.mp4](videos/2_1_05-104-M.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. Because of the vehicle overtaking
- B. Because of the speed limit
- C. Because of the low volume of traffic

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because of the vehicle overtaking

**Explanation:**
The vehicle overtaking in front of you dangerously carries an accident risk, as it can lead to a collision. In order to prevent participation and also to give the other vehicles space to evade, your own speed must be reduced.

---

#### Question 2.1.05-105-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**What should you anticipate in this situation?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_05-105-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. Slow-moving vehicle on my side of the road
- B. Fast oncoming traffic cutting the corner
- C. Wild animals crossing the road

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Slow-moving vehicle on my side of the road
- B. Fast oncoming traffic cutting the corner
- C. Wild animals crossing the road

**Explanation:**
With a confusing right turn you have to expect different situations. Especially at dusk times, wild animals can switch sides right after the turn. But it can also happen that oncoming traffic cuts the curve and is recognized very late or that a vehicle is driving at a very low speed right after the curve.

### 2.1.06 Chapter Overtaking


#### Question 2.1.06-002

**Points:** 5 Points

**Why can it be dangerous if you, as the last in a queue, immediately overtake as soon as the oncoming traffic is past?**

**Options:**
- A. Because you must reckon with others in the queue swinging out to overtake
- B. Because the distance needed to overtake might not be sufficient
- C. Because if you perhaps need to push back into the queue, this could lead to an accident

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because you must reckon with others in the queue swinging out to overtake
- B. Because the distance needed to overtake might not be sufficient
- C. Because if you perhaps need to push back into the queue, this could lead to an accident

**Explanation:**
If a convoy has formed, drivers should basically overtake one after the other. The last of a convoy has the longest overtaking path and must also expect other vehicles starting to overtake in front of him.

#### Question 2.1.06-003-B

**Points:** 4 Points

**What must you remember if you want to overtake?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_06-003-B.png)

**Options:**
- A. The van could start to overtake the vehicle travelling in front of it
- B. Oncoming traffic could appear
- C. As no oncoming traffic is in sight, you may overtake without hesitation

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. The van could start to overtake the vehicle travelling in front of it
- B. Oncoming traffic could appear

**Explanation:**
In an overtaking maneuver you should make sure that the oncoming lane is free. Be sure that there are no bends or gates as well and you only overtake a car. Watch out for more road users, especially trucks.

#### Question 2.1.06-004-B

**Points:** 4 Points

**Are you allowed to overtake the black car on this autobahn on the right?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_06-004-B.png)

**Options:**
- A. No, because there is no queue of vehicles in the left lane
- B. Yes, if you do not drive faster than 80 km/h
- C. Yes, because there is enough space to overtake

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. No, because there is no queue of vehicles in the left lane

**Explanation:**
The black car may not be overtaken on the right in this example. On freeways and highways, you may only overtake on the right as an exception. This is the case, for example, when a vehicle queue has formed on the left.

#### Question 2.1.06-005-B

**Points:** 4 Points

**Both cars are travelling at about 30 km/h. Are you allowed to overtake both before the bend?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_06-005-B.png)

**Options:**
- A. - the distance you need to overtake would be too great
- B. - the light-coloured car could pull out to overtake
- C. - you are not allowed to cross the broken line

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - the distance you need to overtake would be too great
- B. - the light-coloured car could pull out to overtake

**Explanation:**
You may go over the broken line. An overtaking process would still be too dangerous here, because the manageable distance to overtake before the turn is too short. You also have to expect that the driver of the light car will start to overtake.

#### Question 2.1.06-009

**Points:** 4 Points

**Why are you not allowed to overtake here?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_06-009.png)

**Options:**
- A. Because the visible stretch is not sufficient
- B. Because I would not be able to maintain an adequate distance to the side in the event of oncoming traffic
- C. Because I am not permitted to cross the central line

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because the visible stretch is not sufficient
- B. Because I would not be able to maintain an adequate distance to the side in the event of oncoming traffic

**Explanation:**
In general, you must not overtake if the entire overtaking distance is not visible or the side clearance to other road users cannot be met. Both negative factors are given in the present situation: The assessable track is too short for a safe overtaking maneuver. The minimum distance to the cyclists of 1.5 m cannot be met with oncoming traffic.

**Options:**
- A. I overtake [the blue car] and then move into the middle lane
- B. I overtake [the red van] and then move into the middle lane
- C. I brake slightly to prompt the vehicle behind to keep its distance

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I overtake [the blue car] and then move into the middle lane

**Explanation:**
As the car driver, you do not have to dodge to the middle lane when another car pushes you from behind or uses the flash light. You should overtake the blue car and the red van as usual. To change safely to the middle lane, the overtaking process must be completed. Only then you can change.

**Why must you slow down here?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_06-017-M.png)

[Video: videos/2_1_06-017-M.mp4](videos/2_1_06-017-M.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. Because of the overtaking car
- B. Because the maximum permitted speed is 80 km/h
- C. Because of the tractor

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because of the overtaking car

**Explanation:**
The oncoming car overtakes despite opposing traffic about 250 m in front of you. You have to reduce your speed and drive to the far right. So, you defuse the situation and give the overtaking car more time and space to complete the overtaking process. The tractor moves away from the intersection and poses no danger.

#### Question 2.1.06-028-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**Why are you not allowed to overtake here?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_06-028-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. - do not have an adequate view of the road ahead
- B. - cannot maintain an adequate passing distance from the cyclists if there is any oncoming traffic
- C. - may not cross over the central lane markings

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - do not have an adequate view of the road ahead
- B. - cannot maintain an adequate passing distance from the cyclists if there is any oncoming traffic

**Explanation:**
Due to the curve and the trees, you cannot see the rest of the road sufficiently. Out of town, you must keep a minimum distance of 2 metres to the side of cyclists. In the event of sudden oncoming traffic, you would not be able to maintain this distance when overtaking. Therefore, you must not overtake here.

- B. Because I may endanger oncoming traffic
- C. Because I may not cross the centre line

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because the side clearance to the cyclists is too small
- B. Because I may endanger oncoming traffic

**Explanation:**
The road is too small to allow enough side distance to cyclists and oncoming traffic at the same time.

#### Question 2.1.06-030

**Points:** 4 Points

**You want to overtake on a tree-lined avenue. What special aspect should you bear in mind?**

**Options:**
- A. Side clearances are frequently misjudged in this situation
- B. Vehicles with high superstructures frequently perform evasive manoeuvres to avoid branches in this situation
- C. Accidents involving trees are particularly frequent here

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Side clearances are frequently misjudged in this situation
- B. Vehicles with high superstructures frequently perform evasive manoeuvres to avoid branches in this situation
- C. Accidents involving trees are particularly frequent here

**Explanation:**
The avenue is framed by trees. Therefore, the change of light and shadow often leads to the incorrect estimation of distances. Likewise, it can often lead to trees falling and vehicles with high bodies trying to avoid branches.

#### Question 2.1.06-031-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**Why must you discontinue your overtaking manoeuvre here?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_06-031-M.png)

[Video: videos/2_1_06-031-M.mp4](videos/2_1_06-031-M.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. Because the tractor will turn off to the left
- B. Because the motorbike will overtake me
- C. Because I can see a no-overtaking sign

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because the tractor will turn off to the left

**Explanation:**
The tractor starts to turn left. The tractor drives across the left lane of the road. If you overtake now, you would collide with the tractor.

---

#### Question 2.1.06-032

**Points:** 3 Points

**You are driving on a road with one lane for each direction. A convoy of motor vehicles is driving up ahead of you. Why should you refrain from overtaking in order to prevent a dangerous situation from occurring?**

**Options:**
- A. Because the overtaking distance is considerably larger than with single vehicles
- B. Because I should not break the convoy by pulling back into my lane early
- C. Because I cannot assess the road traffic situation ahead of the convoy

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because the overtaking distance is considerably larger than with single vehicles
- B. Because I should not break the convoy by pulling back into my lane early
- C. Because I cannot assess the road traffic situation ahead of the convoy

**Explanation:**
A group of pedestrians, cyclists or motor vehicles, which is traveling together in road traffic, is called a closed association. Closed associations must be clearly marked and must not be interrupted.
Because a closed association consists of several vehicles, you cannot really understand the traffic situation. When overtaking a closed bandage, you should avoid premature inserting, which makes the overtaking path significantly longer.

---

#### Question 2.1.06-033-M

**Points:** 5 Points

**Why is it dangerous to overtake in this situation?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_06-033-M.png)

[Video: videos/2_1_06-033-M.mp4](videos/2_1_06-033-M.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. Because vehicles ahead may swerve out
- B. Because I cannot see far enough along the route necessary for overtaking
- C. Because there is not sufficient space to pull back in between the vehicles ahead

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because vehicles ahead may swerve out
- B. Because I cannot see far enough along the route necessary for overtaking
- C. Because there is not sufficient space to pull back in between the vehicles ahead

**Explanation:**
You are driving in a convoy of several cars behind a lorry on a winding road with oncoming traffic. Ideally, the car behind the lorry overtakes first before the vehicles behind move up and start to overtake. 
On the left-hand bend, you cannot see the overtaking lane sufficiently. You will probably have to cancel the overtaking manoeuvre and pull in between two vehicles. There is a possibility that the distance between the vehicles in front is too small and that you will endanger yourself and other road users by pulling in.

---

#### Question 2.1.06-034-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**Why are you not permitted to overtake in this situation?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_06-034-M.png)

[Video: videos/2_1_06-034-M.mp4](videos/2_1_06-034-M.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. Because the motorbike might overtake me
- B. Because I do not have enough speed
- C. Because overtaking is prohibited here

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because the motorbike might overtake me
- B. Because I do not have enough speed

**Explanation:**
You are not allowed to overtake in this situation because the tractor is travelling too fast for you to overtake it at your maximum speed of 50 km/h.
The motorbike is also approaching at high speed. It will probably overtake you as there is a long straight ahead and no oncoming traffic in sight.

---

#### Question 2.1.06-035-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**The vehicles ahead of you are driving at about 30 km/h. Why are you not permitted to overtake before the road bend?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_06-035-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. Because my overtaking distance is too long
- B. Because the [red] car might pull out to overtake
- C. Because I am not permitted to cross the lane marking

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because my overtaking distance is too long
- B. Because the [red] car might pull out to overtake

**Explanation:**
You are not allowed to overtake before the bend as your overtaking distance is too long to overtake both vehicles before the bend. There is also not enough distance between the two cars for you to pull in. In addition, the red car has the right of way to overtake in front of you; if you both start the overtaking manoeuvre, there is a danger for you and oncoming traffic. As the bend is not visible, you cannot know whether oncoming traffic is coming.

#### Question 2.1.06-103-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**Why do you have to switch to the right-hand lane?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_06-103-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. - [red] car
- B. - [blue] car
- C. - [yellow tractor]

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - [red] car

**Explanation:**
The traffic sign indicates a narrowing (end of a lane) in 200 metres. 
The lane is led into oncoming traffic through the narrowing, so you must be extra vigilant not to end up in oncoming traffic.

**Options:**
- A. I reduce my speed
- B. I maintain my speed
- C. I overtake [the cyclist]

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I reduce my speed

**Explanation:**
You have to reduce your speed because the side distance to the cyclist cannot be kept.

#### Question 2.1.06-107-M

**Points:** 4 Points

**Why should you not overtake the moped rider in this situation?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_06-107-M.png)

[Video: videos/2_1_06-107-M.mp4](videos/2_1_06-107-M.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. Because this might cause the moped rider to fall
- B. Because I am not allowed to drive significantly faster than the moped rider
- C. Because I am unable to maintain the requisite amount of side clearance

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because this might cause the moped rider to fall
- B. Because I am not allowed to drive significantly faster than the moped rider
- C. Because I am unable to maintain the requisite amount of side clearance

**Explanation:**
In the roadworks area, the speed limit is 30 km/h and the road is narrowed. 
You are therefore not allowed to drive as fast as would be necessary to overtake the moped rider safely. 
Due to the narrowness of the road, you cannot keep the required distance to the side and the poor condition of the road could cause the moped rider to fall if you overtake him.

### 2.1.07 Chapter Special Traffic Situations


#### Question 2.1.07-002-B

**Points:** 3 Points

**What must you reckon with on this autobahn car park?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_07-002-B.png)

**Options:**
- A. People suddenly stepping onto the roadway
- B. Danger of skidding when you brake
- C. Oncoming traffic

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. People suddenly stepping onto the roadway
- B. Danger of skidding when you brake

**Explanation:**
The surface of this freeway parking lot consists of cobblestones that are not only uneven but also wet. Be prepared for the fact that the braking distance of your vehicle is extended by the lower traction. You do not have to expect oncoming vehicles. Careless pedestrians, however, can unexpectedly step onto the road at any time.

#### Question 2.1.07-004-B

**Points:** 3 Points

**What do you do if you want to drive straight on?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_07-004-B.png)

**Options:**
- A. Brake so that the driver in front can change lanes
- B. 'Overtake the other vehicle in the left-hand lane since the traffic light is "green"'
- C. Sound your horn to indicate to the driver in front that he may not change lanes so close to the crossroads

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Brake so that the driver in front can change lanes

**Explanation:**
You behave correctly if you reduce the speed of your vehicle and allow the preceding vehicle to change lane. The left lane may only be used for the purpose of turning left. Since you want to drive straight in the example, you must not use the left lane.

#### Question 2.1.07-006-B

**Points:** 3 Points

**You are approaching the vehicles in this picture. What do you do?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_07-006-B.png)

**Options:**
- A. Watch if the truck and trailer remain on the hard shoulder
- B. Allow the truck and trailer to enter the roadway when it indicates left
- C. When the truck and trailer are indicating left, flash your headlights and proceed at a brisk pace

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Watch if the truck and trailer remain on the hard shoulder
- B. Allow the truck and trailer to enter the roadway when it indicates left

**Explanation:**
Outside of built-up areas, slow vehicles such as tractors, trucks and mopeds often ride on the hard shoulder and can thus be overtaken more easily. If such a vehicle wants to turn left, or if it has to return to the main road for other reasons, you have to allow the driver to change his/her lane.

#### Question 2.1.07-015-M

**Points:** 5 Points

**Why should you further reduce your speed here?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_07-015-M.png)

[Video: videos/2_1_07-015-M.mp4](videos/2_1_07-015-M.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. Because the [red] car could cross onto my lane
- B. Because other people may walk onto the road
- C. Because [the blue car] could continue moving

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because the [red] car could cross onto my lane
- B. Because other people may walk onto the road

**Explanation:**
It's unlikely that the car in the left lane will continue as it appears to have broken down. Even if it did, it wouldn't affect you. However, since there is a person in the lane, extra caution is required here. It's also possible that other people get out of the vehicle and run onto the road. The stationary car may be hidden by the bush or no warning triangle was set up. The following car could therefore recognize too late that the vehicle has stopped in front of it. You should therefore drive with foresight and expect the car behind to swerve into your lane.

**Options:**
- A. Because the red vehicle could cross onto my lane
- B. Because other people may walk onto the road
- C. Because otherwise my vehicle could leave the road

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because the red vehicle could cross onto my lane
- B. Because other people may walk onto the road

**Explanation:**
On the left lane a car has broken down. There's a person standing in front of the vehicle. Other passengers could leave the car and enter the lane. The approaching vehicle in the opposite lane could dodge onto your lane to overtake the broken-down vehicle and drive past the obstacle. If you delay, the danger of the situation would be reduced

#### Question 2.1.07-029

**Points:** 4 Points

**What must you be aware of when driving along narrow avenues?**

**Options:**
- A. - it is frequently difficult for me to see into the road bends
- B. - I have to drive particularly defensively
- C. - I am protected against black ice

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - it is frequently difficult for me to see into the road bends
- B. - I have to drive particularly defensively

**Explanation:**
Visibility in avenues is more restricted than in open fields and therefore requires an adapted driving style.
On bends, your view of the carriageway may be restricted after the bend. You may therefore only see obstacles very late.

**Options:**
- A. I stop behind the taxi
- B. I moving into the left-hand lane
- C. I carefully drive past the taxi on the right

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I stop behind the taxi

**Explanation:**
There is no other option for you in this situation other than to pull over behind the taxi. Because you are not allowed to pass to the right of the taxi as this is a sidewalk. Driving on a sidewalk is generally prohibited.
You also can't change to the left lane because there is a motorcycle next to you. If you change lane you risk a collision.

#### Question 2.1.07-031

**Points:** 3 Points

**You are taking part in a group tour with several motorbikes. What is the right behaviour?**

**Options:**
- A. I keep my position in the group
- B. I make sure I keep a safe distance from the motorbike in front
- C. I always ride as fast as the motorbike in front

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I keep my position in the group
- B. I make sure I keep a safe distance from the motorbike in front

**Explanation:**
Your position in the group should be decided before the group ride and should not change during the ride to avoid constant position changes. You should always pay attention to the necessary safety distance from the motorcycle in front of you.
This prevents potentially dangerous situations with other motorcycles or oncoming traffic and allows you to react in a timely manner to dangers or sudden changes in speed.

- C. Keeping your hazard warning lights switched on when driving

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Watching the queue through the windows of the vehicles travelling in front
- B. Driving in a slightly staggered position in your own lane

**Explanation:**
Slightly offset driving allows you to observe the vehicles in front. This allows you to see the traffic situation in front of you or through the windows of the driver in front and react faster to sudden events. Driving with hazard lights in a convoy is generally prohibited.

#### Question 2.1.07-109

**Points:** 3 Points

**You increase your speed from 50 km/h to 100 km/h. How is the braking distance changed according to the rule of thumb?**

**Options:**
- A. It is quadrupled from 25 m to 100 m
- B. It is doubled from 15 m to 30 m
- C. It is halved from 50 m to 25 m

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. It is quadrupled from 25 m to 100 m

**Explanation:**
According to the rule of thumb, the braking distance quadruples when the speed doubles. At 40 km/h, for example, it is 16 meters and at 80 km/h 64 meters.

#### Question 2.1.07-110

**Points:** 3 Points

**When leaving a built-up area, both you and the vehicle approximately 15 m ahead of you increase speed from 50 km/h to 100 km/h. How should you change the safety distance between you and the vehicle ahead?**

**Options:**
- A. - increase to at least 50 m
- B. - remain the same
- C. - increase to at least 25 m

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - increase to at least 50 m

**Explanation:**
Keep a safe distance from the vehicle in front of you outside of closed areas that is at least half the speed in meters. At 100 km/h, the safety distance should therefore be at least 50 meters.

#### Question 2.1.07-111

**Points:** 5 Points

**Why must you be ready to brake in this situation?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_07-111.png)

[Video: videos/2_1_07-111.mp4](videos/2_1_07-111.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. Because the other vehicle might continue moving
- B. Because the direction of the road ahead demands it
- C. Because a speed limit is visible

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because the other vehicle might continue moving

**Explanation:**
You see that a vehicle wants to drive onto the road from the right. Since it comes from a field or forest path, you have right of way. Due to the forest cover the visibility for the vehicle driver may be limited. It is possible that he/she will continue despite having to wait. For this reason, you must be ready to brake until you clearly recognize that he/she is stopping.

#### Question 2.1.07-112

**Points:** 5 Points

**Why should you lower your speed now?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_07-112.png)

[Video: videos/2_1_07-112.mp4](videos/2_1_07-112.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. Because I am badly visible to other road users
- B. Because the direction of the road ahead demands it
- C. Because I have to give right of way

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because I am badly visible to other road users

**Explanation:**
Basically, you have the right of way, because you are on a priority road. However, to avoid a dangerous situation, you should still reduce your speed and be ready to brake, as the car driver of the car coming from the right-hand side might recognize you too late or miss you altogether. Due to the trees on the roadside his/her view is clearly limited.

**Options:**
- A. I slow down
- B. I accelerate
- C. I continue driving as before

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I slow down

**Explanation:**
In this situation, you need to reduce the speed and allow the car driver to go back into lane on the left. If a lane ends on a multi-lane road or if it is not possible for the drivers driving on the other lane to drive through the lane continuously, they must be able to change lanes using the zipper procedure.

**Options:**
- A. - motorcyclist will slow down
- B. - tractor will proceed onto the road
- C. - tractor will wait

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - motorcyclist will slow down
- B. - tractor will proceed onto the road

**Explanation:**
Although you are on the priority road, you must always expect dangerous situations to arise. For example, the tractor driver approaching your street at a junction could not fulfill his duty of waiting and force the vehicle in front of you to brake. By driving anticipatory you can help defuse potentially dangerous situations.

#### Question 2.1.07-115

**Points:** 5 Points

**What is the right course of action in this situation?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_07-115.png)

[Video: videos/2_1_07-115.mp4](videos/2_1_07-115.mp4)

**Options:**
- A. I maintain my speed and continue driving as before
- B. I accelerate in order to create a large enough safety distance
- C. I brake briefly in order that that the driver behind will reduce his speed

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I maintain my speed and continue driving as before

**Explanation:**
The maximum speed limit on this road is 80 km/h. You drive 80 km/h. The driver driving behind you harasses you to drive quicker; he/she comes dangerously close and falls below the required safety distance. Keep your speed. If you try to increase the safety margin by accelerating, the driver behind you will probably also accelerate. Braking, even briefly, endangers you and the car behind.

**Options:**
- A. I brake sharply and immediately
- B. I take no evasive movement
- C. I swerve towards the left

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I brake sharply and immediately
- B. I take no evasive movement

**Explanation:**
If you suddenly have to brake immediately as much as possible, you stay on your lane and, if necessary, accept that you collide with the obstacle. Do not turn left because of oncoming traffic. Dodging to the right is out of the question as well, because you will get off the lane and possibly drive against one of the trees.

- C. That the van continues driving on the priority road

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. That the [red car] fails to see me
- B. That the children will cross the road

**Explanation:**
In this situation, it is likely that the black car did not see you on your motorcycle. The children further down the road are likely to cross the road. The red van will not continue on the priority road and is turning right as indicated by his blinkers

#### Question 2.1.07-119

**Points:** 3 Points

**What should you do, if it is no longer possible to avoid a collision with wild animals?**

**Options:**
- A. I brake as hard as possible
- B. I maintain my direction of movement
- C. I always take an evasive movement

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I brake as hard as possible
- B. I maintain my direction of movement

**Explanation:**
If a collision with an animal is no longer avoidable, the direction of travel is to be maintained. Then brake hard and hold the steering wheel firmly. An evasive maneuver can injure other road users or increase the risk of greater damage than a controlled collision with the animal.

**Options:**
- A. - restore the safety distance by braking
- B. - overtake the motorbike
- C. - move to the right-hand lane

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - restore the safety distance by braking

**Explanation:**
You must interrupt the cruise control by braking. The motorcyclist changes to your safety distance. You can restore it only by breaking. It is not possible to change to the right-hand lane, as otherwise you would get into the safety distance of the vehicles in succession. The speed limit prohibits to drive faster than 130 km/h.

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Motorcyclists encroaching into my lane due to their strongly tilted position when cornering
- B. Motorcyclists cutting corners
- C. Motorcyclists overtaking me in a risky manner

**Explanation:**
On curvy roads, motorcyclists can cut their curves or protrude on your roadway in curves because of their strong inclinations. Even motorcyclists who drive in the same direction of travel can also take advantage of the curves and could tend to carry out risky overtaking maneuvers.

**Options:**
- A. I reduce my speed
- B. I drive as far to the right as possible
- C. I signal to the motorcyclist that he can overtake me

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I reduce my speed
- B. I drive as far to the right as possible

**Explanation:**
On confusing roadways or when there is oncoming traffic on a narrow street, you should always pay close attention to other road users and adjust your speed. In this way, dangerous situations can be reduced in advance. 
You should also drive as far to the right as possible to avoid a collision with the oncoming truck. You can't see through the tree how far in the middle the oncoming truck is driving. You also create more space on the road if the motorcycle behind you tries to overtake and hasn't seen the truck yet.

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I am unable to see vehicles and pedestrians in the blind spot
- B. Rear-view mirrors must be adjusted to the particular driver

**Explanation:**
Using the rear-view mirrors requires you to know the following: 1. Rear-view mirrors must be adjusted to the driver before starting to drive. 2. There are blind spots on all types of rear-view mirrors. These indicate areas hidden from view in which pedestrians, small vehicles or obstacles can be overlooked. By optimally adjusting the outer rearview mirror and the inner mirror, you keep the blind spot as low as possible.

#### Question 2.1.07-204

**Points:** 4 Points

**You are driving into a right-hand bend. A motorcyclist approaches you at high speed. What risks should you take into account?**

**Options:**
- A. - will intrude into my lane because of the heavily tilted position
- B. - will cut the corner and intrude into my lane
- C. - will brake in good time and avoid intruding into my lane

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - will intrude into my lane because of the heavily tilted position
- B. - will cut the corner and intrude into my lane

**Explanation:**
As you enter a right-hand turn, the oncoming motorcyclist makes a left turn. His upper body is tilted towards you. Bear in mind that the motorcyclist is almost as wide as a car while doing that. If the rider is riding too far at the center line to increase the radius of curvature and lower centrifugal forces, his upper body could be caught by your vehicle.

#### Question 2.1.08-006-B

**Points:** 3 Points

**What must you do here?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_08-006-B.png)

**Options:**
- A. Check your speed again and, if necessary, brake
- B. Brake only on the bend so as not to obstruct traffic following behind

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Check your speed again and, if necessary, brake

**Explanation:**
If the car driver drives at high speed on the highway for a long time, the senses get used to the fast pace. There is a risk of underestimating the pace. In particular, if you want to drive out, check your speed on the speedometer. Use the deceleration lane of the freeway to reduce your speed. Braking there doesn't hinder anybody. Then you can enter the sharp bend of the exit at a reasonable speed.

#### Question 2.1.08-030-M

**Points:** 3 Points

**You want to leave the motorway. What is the right course of action?**

![Question Image](images/2_1_08-030-M.png)

**Options:**
- A. I use the speedometer to check my speed at short intervals
- B. I reduce my speed now
- C. I reduce my speed only once I am at the turn

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. I use the speedometer to check my speed at short intervals
- B. I reduce my speed now

**Explanation:**
As soon as you have entered the deceleration lane, you should brake. If you brake before entering the deceleration lane, you will unnecessarily interfere with traffic on the motorway. You should check your speedometer more often to make sure you are not entering the bend too fast. On motorways, there is a danger that you will get too used to the high speed and therefore enter an exit too fast. If you were to slow down at the turn, you would not be able to reduce your speed in time. In general, you should always brake before a bend and not only in the bend.

**Options:**
- A. The time saved is frequently insignificant
- B. Vehicles in the right-hand lane may cross over the yellow road markings
- C. The risk of an accident increases significantly

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. The time saved is frequently insignificant
- B. Vehicles in the right-hand lane may cross over the yellow road markings
- C. The risk of an accident increases significantly

**Explanation:**
When overtaking in the construction site area, the risk of accidents is significantly increased, because there is a risk that the vehicles that you want to overtake run over the yellow lane marking. The lanes are mostly narrower and the distractions on the edge of the road can lead to inattentiveness.
Overtaking in the construction site area often saves almost no time, since most drivers in the construction site area only drive the maximum speed.

### 2.1.10 Chapter Fatigue Distraction


#### Question 2.1.10-001

**Points:** 4 Points

**What must you do if you notice signs of fatigue when driving on open stretches of road at night (heavy eyelids, feeling chilly, sudden frights etc.)?**

**Options:**
- A. Interrupt your journey for an adequate break
- B. Switch on the radio and proceed

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Interrupt your journey for an adequate break

**Explanation:**
You can only avoid signs of fatigue if you take sufficiently long breaks in time. Do not turn on the radio to stay awake, as there is a risk it will distract you further. If you already feel the first symptoms of fatigue, find a place where you can take a longer break as soon as possible.

#### Question 2.1.10-002

**Points:** 4 Points

**How can fatigue be prevented on a long journey?**

**Options:**

- C. Drink coffee and make no stops

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. By well-timed and sufficient stops for rests
- B. Gymnastic exercises during stops

- A. Telephoning
- B. Lighting a cigarette
- C. Nagging children on the backseats

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Telephoning

---

#### Question 2.1.11-018

**Points:** 3 Points

**Why is it not advisable to change lanes frequently?**

**Options:**
- A. Because this can increase the risk of driving errors
- B. Because the time gained by this is generally very small
- C. Because this can endanger other road users

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Because this can increase the risk of driving errors
- B. Because the time gained by this is generally very small
- C. Because this can endanger other road users

**Explanation:**
Every lane change requires certain activities: observing traffic, flashing, changing the lane yourself. In this case, other road users can be overlooked and endangered. Changing lanes often doesn't save you much time, but the more often you change lanes, the more likely you are to make mistakes.

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. ({Speed in km/h}/{10} x {Speed in km/h}/{10}) : 2

**Explanation:**
The rule of thumb for determining the stopping distance is: thinking distance (speed divided by 10 times 3) plus braking distance (speed divided by 10 times speed divided by 10). At 50 km/h, this is 50 divided by 10 times 3 equals 15 m thinking distance plus 50 divided by 10 times 50 divided by 10 equals 25 m braking distance. The stopping distance is 40 m.

### 2.2.05 Chapter Overtaking


#### Question 2.2.05-005

**Points:** 5 Points

**You are driving at 100 km/h on a road not inside a built-up area. In front of you a truck is travelling at 70 km/h. What is the minimum distance you must be from a crest in the road when commencing an overtaking manoeuvre?**

**Options:**
- A. 800 m
- B. 200 m
- C. 400 m

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. 800 m

**Explanation:**
The rule of thumb for the overtaking path is calculated from the speeds, the overtaking time and the vehicle lengths. The formula is s = v1 / (v1−v2) * (l1+l2+sv+sh). V1/ (V1-V2)) times L. V1 =100 km/h, V2 = 70 km/h, L = 2 times 50 m safety distance plus the vehicle lengths. Truck 12.5 m plus car 4.5 m = 17 m. L = 117 m. 100 km/h divided by 30 km/h times 117 m = 389.9 m, that means 400 m overtaking path. In confusing areas this has to be doubled. You must be at least 800 meters from the crest of the road.

#### Question 2.2.22-008

**Points:** 3 Points

**How does an improperly stowed load affect the driving stability of a motorbike?**

**Options:**
- A. A heavy load placed on the rear causes the motorbike to wobble and sway at high speeds
- B. A load placed on one side only negatively affects the handling
- C. Light-weight luggage in the tank bag makes skidding more probable

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. A heavy load placed on the rear causes the motorbike to wobble and sway at high speeds
- B. A load placed on one side only negatively affects the handling

**Explanation:**
Too heavy a load at the rear of the motorbike puts too little weight on the front tyres and steering. This makes it easier for the bike to wobble and oscillate. Differently loaded sides have a negative effect on stability and handling. The motorbike will lean more towards the heavier side when braking or cornering.
Light luggage in the tank bag does not affect the riding stability of the motorbike.

#### Question 2.2.22-222

**Points:** 3 Points

**What can help with friction-locked load securing?**

**Options:**
- A. Lashing straps
- B. Anti-slip mats
- C. Lashing chains

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Lashing straps
- B. Anti-slip mats
- C. Lashing chains

**Explanation:**
In force-locking load securing, the transported goods are pressed onto the loading surface by means of lashing. This type of lashing is also known as tie-down lashing.
The load usually stands freely on the loading surface and is only secured by the increased force applied. In most cases, the frictional force between the loading surface and the load is increased.
The load is secured with the aid of load securing equipment such as lashing straps, lashing chains, anti-slip mats or cover nets and with the aid of attachment points on the loading surface.
This prevents the load from slipping.

#### Question 2.2.22-224

**Points:** 3 Points

**You want to secure your load by lashing it down. What should you bear in mind?**

**Options:**
- A. - regularly check the tension of the lashing equipment
- B. - only secure dimensionally stable loads by lashing them down
- C. - choose the smallest possible lashing angle

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - regularly check the tension of the lashing equipment
- B. - only secure dimensionally stable loads by lashing them down

**Explanation:**
When lashing down, the load is pressed onto the loading area using lashing devices to increase the friction force and prevent slipping. It is important to check the tension of the lashing devices, as the necessary contact force and thus the required friction can only be achieved with sufficient tension. In addition, this method is only suitable for dimensionally stable loads; flexible goods can deform under the tension, which means that the pre-tensioning force is lost and load securing is no longer guaranteed.

#### Question 2.5.01-106

**Points:** 3 Points

**What results in increased fuel consumption of your car?**

**Options:**
- A. A roof rack or ski rack
- B. Transporting unnecessary objects
- C. Excessive tyre pressure

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. A roof rack or ski rack
- B. Transporting unnecessary objects

**Explanation:**
Increased fuel consumption can be expected if, for example, you install roof or ski racks or if you load your vehicle with unnecessary objects. Increased tire pressure, on the other hand, does not matter for fuel consumption, even if it should be avoided altogether.

#### Question 2.5.01-107

**Points:** 3 Points

**How can you save fuel?**

**Options:**
- A. By observing at least the tyre pressure indicated in the owner's manual
- B. By removing roof racks or ski racks
- C. Avoid driving in top gear

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. By observing at least the tyre pressure indicated in the owner's manual
- B. By removing roof racks or ski racks

**Explanation:**
Additional load and additional attachments such as roof racks or ski holders increase fuel consumption: when not in use, remove them. You save fuel when driving low-speed: shift up the gear early. Turning off the air conditioning system saves fuel, as does maintaining tire pressure according to the manufacturer's specifications. Because too little tire pressure increases the rolling resistance.

#### Question 2.5.01-127

**Points:** 3 Points

**What increases the range of an electric vehicle?**

**Options:**
- A. Using a high energy recovery (recuperation) level
- B. Reducing the heater temperature
- C. Short, sharp acceleration

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Using a high energy recovery (recuperation) level
- B. Reducing the heater temperature

**Explanation:**
If you only brake slightly, the electric motor brakes and the kinetic energy is recovered. If you brake harder, you will be mechanically braked and the kinetic energy will not be recovered. Due to a high recuperation level, an electric car behaves like a combustion engine, so you may have to brake less strongly, i.e. mechanically. The heating in the electric car is fed directly from the battery and thus consumes energy that could also be used for driving.

---

#### Question 2.5.01-128

**Points:** 3 Points

**What is the benefit of recuperation in an electric vehicle?**

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - increases range
- B. - conserves the service brake system
- C. - means that energy can be recovered from the braking operation

**Explanation:**
Recuperation means "recovery". Just as electrical energy was converted into kinetic energy, braking converts the kinetic energy back into electrical energy, which is then fed back into the battery. This increases the range of the electric vehicle.

#### Question 2.6.03-121

**Points:** 3 Points

**What can affect the driving stability of a towed trailer?**

**Options:**
- A. A centre of gravity that is far back in the trailer
- B. Insufficient tyre pressure in the trailer tyres
- C. A leaking shock absorber

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. A centre of gravity that is far back in the trailer
- B. Insufficient tyre pressure in the trailer tyres
- C. A leaking shock absorber

**Explanation:**
The load of a trailer should be distributed so that the center of gravity is as close as possible to the axle of the trailer. This ensures optimal driving stability and controllability of the trailer.
A load center of gravity that is far back can have a serious impact on the driving stability of your trailer. This can cause the trailer to sway more easily during sudden steering movements or at higher speeds, increasing the risk of an accident.
If the tire pressure on your trailer is too low, it can affect the driving stability of your trailer. On the one hand, low tire pressure leads to poorer road grip, which makes your trailer more uncontrollable when cornering. On the other hand, low tire pressure leads to increased tire wear, which increases the risk of tire damage while driving.
A shock absorber that is already leaking can also have a negative impact on the driving stability of your trailer. The leaking shock absorber on your trailer loses its damping properties, which can lead to unstable driving behavior and dangerous situations that are difficult to control.

**A single-axle trailer has an actual gross weight of 600 kg. What is the minimum possible vertical load?**

**Options:**
- A. 24 kg (= 4%)
- B. 60 kg (= 10%)
- C. 90 kg (= 15%)

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. 24 kg (= 4%)

**Explanation:**
The bearing load is the mass that rests on the coupling device of the towing vehicle. To determine it, the car driver can place a piece of wood or a pipe underneath the coupling point of the trailer and place a bathroom scale underneath. The bearing load is displayed. The minimum load to be carried by the towing vehicle shall not be less than 4% of the trailer's total weight for trailers with a gross vehicle weight of not more than 3.5 tons. However, a minimum load of 25 kg is sufficient. In this example, the minimum support load is 24 kg. When loading the trailer, you, as a car driver, must be careful not to undercut or exceed the minimum and maximum permitted load. By shifting the load, you can influence the bearing load.

#### Question 2.7.01-026

**Points:** 4 Points

**What is correct when driving round bends on downhill slopes?**

**Options:**
- A. Brake adequately before the bend so that no additional braking is needed on the bend
- B. Start taking the bend so that you do not get into the area of oncoming traffic even when you are leaning far over
- C. When you do not see any oncoming traffic, follow the ideal line and use the whole width of the roadway

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Brake adequately before the bend so that no additional braking is needed on the bend
- B. Start taking the bend so that you do not get into the area of oncoming traffic even when you are leaning far over

#### Question 2.7.01-027

**Points:** 4 Points

**You are driving round a bend at a brisk pace which is tighter than you first thought. What do you do?**

**Options:**
- A. Throttle back, lean further over
- B. Do not brake sharply
- C. Make an immediate sharp steering movement

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Throttle back, lean further over
- B. Do not brake sharply

**Explanation:**
In this situation, making a sharp steering movement will be dangerous and could lead to a fall. You should decelerate gradually and lean further to turn more. If you brake sharply while turning, a torque force would tilt you from leaning to one side to a more upward position which will increase the radius of your turn

#### Question 2.7.01-071

**Points:** 3 Points

**What should you take into account when you have to brake unexpectedly sharply while driving around a road bend?**

**Options:**
- A. My motorcycle tends to drive straight ahead
- B. I should counter-steer gently
- C. The driving line of my motorcycle remains unchanged

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. My motorcycle tends to drive straight ahead
- B. I should counter-steer gently

**Explanation:**
When you brake in a bend, your motorbike is lifted up by the force of inertia. You have to counteract this by counter-steering with feeling. Otherwise you will continue straight ahead and not make the bend.

#### Question 2.7.01-072

**Points:** 3 Points

**In bends with poor road conditions, what increases the risk of skidding?**

**Options:**
- A. Having a damaged chassis
- B. Having the wrong tyre inflation pressure
- C. Having a wrongly loaded cargo

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Having a damaged chassis
- B. Having the wrong tyre inflation pressure
- C. Having a wrongly loaded cargo

**Explanation:**
Ideally, all wheels should press on the road with the same force to ensure optimum grip and handling. If this is not the case, it can increase the risk of skidding in poor road conditions.
The suspension, for example, has the task of keeping all tyres on the road with the same force. If the suspension is damaged, it can no longer do this. The risk of skidding also increases if the tyre pressure is incorrect or if the vehicle is incorrectly or unevenly loaded.
This is because the tyres cannot apply the same force to the road and you lose grip more quickly.

Avoid speeding up between bends, because speeding up would put even more strain on the brakes. Therefore, ride downhill without speeding up. 
Use the front and rear brakes evenly and try to use the braking effect of the motor to relieve the brakes. The higher the engine speed, the greater the braking effect.

#### Question 2.7.01-074

**Points:** 3 Points

**When is there a risk that the front wheel of the motorbike will lose contact with the carriageway?**

**Options:**
- A. - accelerate in a low gear
- B. - accelerate while carrying a pillion passenger
- C. - brake using the front-wheel brake

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - accelerate in a low gear
- B. - accelerate while carrying a pillion passenger

**Explanation:**
When speeding up, the weight shifts to the back. Extreme speeding in a low gear shifts the centre of gravity behind the rear axle and the front wheel lifts off.
A passenger also shifts the weight to the rear when speeding up. This weight shift relieves the front wheel and can cause it to lift off.

#### Question 2.7.01-075

**Points:** 3 Points

**What might happen if you shift to a low gear while travelling at a high speed?**

**Options:**
- A. The rear wheel may lock
- B. There is a high risk of crashing to the ground
- C. The front wheel may lift up from the road surface

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. The rear wheel may lock
- B. There is a high risk of crashing to the ground

**Explanation:**
The sudden, rapid increase in engine speed when engaging the clutch creates a braking effect. The engine braking force can cause your rear wheel to lock up or slip and lose grip on the road. You could lose control of your motorbike and crash.

#### Question 2.7.01-076

**Points:** 4 Points

**How should you respond if your motorbike begins to wobble?**

**Options:**
- A. - immediately release the accelerator and slow down
- B. - avoid high speeds as I continue my journey
- C. - counter-steer right now

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - immediately release the accelerator and slow down
- B. - avoid high speeds as I continue my journey

**Explanation:**
By reducing the speed immediately, you can reduce swaying and increase driving stability. Swaying occurs at high speeds. So avoid driving very fast when continuing your journey.

#### Question 2.7.01-078

**Points:** 2 Points

**What applies to the effectiveness of the front and rear wheel brakes, especially at higher speeds?**

**Options:**
- A. - of the front brake is larger
- B. - of the rear wheel brake is larger
- C. - of the front and rear wheel brakes are equally powerful

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - of the front brake is larger

**Explanation:**
When braking, the weight shifts forward, which puts greater strain on the front wheel. That's why the front wheel brake is usually designed for higher braking effects in order to make the greater load easier to control.

#### Question 2.7.01-079

**Points:** 3 Points

**What can cause a motorcycle to oscillate at high speed?**

**Options:**
- A. - with unbalanced wheels
- B. - on uneven road surfaces
- C. - with heavy luggage at the rear

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - with unbalanced wheels
- B. - on uneven road surfaces
- C. - with heavy luggage at the rear

**Explanation:**
At high speeds on uneven roads or if the wheels are not balanced, your motorcycle tends to "sway" more quickly because the unevenness changes the road's position.
If you have a heavy load on the rear of your motorcycle, there will be less weight on the front wheel. At high speeds, your motorcycle may sway, making it harder for you to control your motorcycle.

**Options:**
- A. Braking distance increases
- B. Reaction distance increases
- C. Stopping distance reduces

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Braking distance increases

**Explanation:**
Note that a fully loaded trailer without its own brake extends the braking distance and thus the stopping distance by the respective trailer load. The thinking distance does not change in this case.

---

#### Question 2.7.01-109

**Points:** 3 Points

**You want to tow a singe-axle caravan trailer behind your car. What must you check?**

**Options:**
- A. If the permissible trailer load or the permissible coupling of the car are exceeded

#### Question 2.7.01-113

**Points:** 3 Points

**When driving, you notice that the car constantly pulls to the left. What could be the cause of this?**

**Options:**
- A. Too little air in the front left tyre
- B. Incorrect wheel adjustment at the front axle (track, wheel camber)
- C. The left rear tyre is extensively worn

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Too little air in the front left tyre
- B. Incorrect wheel adjustment at the front axle (track, wheel camber)

**Explanation:**
If your vehicle pulls to the left so that countersteering is required, too little air pressure in the left tire could be the cause or a different wheel setting. A badly worn tire usually does not have this effect.

#### Question 2.7.01-118

**Points:** 3 Points

**What are the advantages of an anti-slip device (ASR)?**

**Options:**
- A. No wheelspin when setting off
- B. Reduced danger of sliding sideways when setting off on a slippery roadway
- C. No locking of the wheels when braking

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. No wheelspin when setting off
- B. Reduced danger of sliding sideways when setting off on a slippery roadway

**Explanation:**
The traction control system (TCS) of a car prevents the wheels of the vehicle from spinning, especially when accelerating faster. Slipping away to the side when starting to drive on slippery roads is thereby largely prevented.

#### Question 2.7.01-145

**Points:** 3 Points

**With which driving task can the lane keep assist system with steering override help the driver?**

**Options:**
- A. When driving in a straight line
- B. When turning
- C. When overtaking

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. When driving in a straight line

**Explanation:**
If the lane markings are good, Lane Keeping Assist with steering intervention can help you to keep the vehicle on the lane when driving straight ahead.
When turning, you cross lanes and markings; the lane departure warning system cannot intervene to support you here. When overtaking, you signal to the lane departure warning system by flashing that you are crossing the lane markings intentionally. Thus, it does not intervene during the overtaking process.

#### Question 2.7.01-165

**Points:** 3 Points

**You are driving an electric vehicle. When can recuperation inhibit the braking action?**

**Options:**
- A. - with a fully charged battery
- B. - at less than the battery’s operating temperature
- C. - in eco mode

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. - with a fully charged battery
- B. - at less than the battery’s operating temperature

**Explanation:**
By recuperation, the engine of the electric vehicle works like a generator when braking. The braking therefore generates electricity and automatically loads the car battery. So if the battery of the electric vehicle is already fully charged, the vehicle cannot regain the energy and the braking effect through recuperation may not be available. Instead, the vehicle has to fall back on conventional brakes. The recuperation can also be reduced or deactivated if the battery is too cold. This can reduce the braking effect through recuperation.

#### Question 2.7.01-260

**Points:** 3 Points

**What can you expect if you take a truck with a heavy load and drive it around a tight bend?**

**Options:**
- A. The lorry can tip over if driven too fast
- B. Insufficiently secured cargo can slip
- C. The lorry handles better on bends

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. The lorry can tip over if driven too fast
- B. Insufficiently secured cargo can slip

**Explanation:**
A heavily loaded truck can tip over when negotiating a tight curve, or inadequately secured cargo can slip because of centrifugal forces that are proportional to the mass of the vehicle and the cargo. These forces can destabilize the vehicle and cause it to tip over, especially if the center of gravity is high. Inadequately secured loads can slip due to these forces, further affecting the vehicle's balance and increasing the risk of accidents. Correct load securing is therefore essential to ensure the stability of the vehicle and increase road safety.

#### Question 2.7.02-022

**Points:** 3 Points

**If tyre pressure is too high or too low, what can this cause?**

**Options:**
- A. Road behaviour can deteriorate
- B. Tyre wear can increase
- C. Reaction distance can be longer

**Correct Answer(s):**
- A. Road behaviour can deteriorate
- B. Tyre wear can increase

**Explanation:**
If the internal tire pressure is too high or too low, the driving behavior will deteriorate. In addition, the tire wear increases. If the tire pressure is too low, the tire heats up by flexing, while the "soft" tire is excessively compressed and relieved at the footprint. The consequences are an increased fuel consumption and a high rolling resistance, in addition, the driving stability decreases. If the tire pressure is too high, the tire may burst. It is important to check the tire pressure regularly and to take the information recommended by the manufacturer into account. The tire pressure has no influence on the thinking distance.
